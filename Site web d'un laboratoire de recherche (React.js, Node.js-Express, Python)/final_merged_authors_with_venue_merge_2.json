        "Description": "Internet of things (IoT) constitutes one of the most important technological development in the last decade. It has the potential to deeply affect our life style. However, its success relies greatly on a well-defined architecture that will provide scalable, dynamic, and secure basement to its deployment. In fact, several challenges stand between the conceptual idea of IoT, and the full deployment of its applications into our daily life. IoT deployment is closely related to the establishment of a standard architecture. This architecture should support future extensions, and covers IoT characteristics such as distributivity, interoperability, and scalability. A well defined, scalable, backward compatible, and secure architecture is required to bring the IoT concept closer to reality. In the literature, several architectures have been proposed. Nevertheless, each architecture brings a share of drawbacks, and fails covering all IoT …",

        "Description": "Key distribution is required to secure e-health applications in the context of Internet of Things (IoT). However, resources constraints in IoT make these applications unable to run existing key management protocols. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight key management protocol. This protocol is based on collaboration to establish a secure end-to-end communication channel between a highly resource constrained node and a remote entity. The secure channel allows the constrained node to transmit captured data while ensuring confidentiality and authentication. To achieve this goal, we propose offloading highly consuming cryptographic primitives to third parties. As a result, the constrained node obtains assistance from powerful entities. To assess our protocol, we conduct a formal validation regarding security properties. In addition, we evaluate both communication and computational costs to highlight energy …",

For sensitive and mission-critical sensing tasks, securing multicast applications is therefore highly desirable. To secure group communications, several group key management protocols have been introduced. However, the majority of the proposed solutions are not adapted to the IoT and its strong processing, storage, and energy constraints. In this context, we introduce a novel decentralized and batch-based group key management protocol to secure multicast communications. Our protocol is simple and it reduces the rekeying overhead triggered by membership changes in dynamic and mobile groups and guarantees both backward and forward secrecy. To assess our protocol, we conduct a detailed analysis with respect to its communication and storage costs …",

Nevertheless, IoT will likely present dynamic and mobile applications. In this paper, we introduce potential security threats on RPL, in particular Sybil attack when the Sybil nodes are mobile. In addition, we present an analytical analysis and a discussion on how network performances can be affected. Our analysis shows, under Sybil attack while nodes are mobile, that the performances of RPL are highly affected compared to the static case. In fact, we notice a decrease in the rate of packet delivery, and an increase in control messages overhead. As a result, energy consumption at constrained …",

Among these issues, key distribution for heterogeneous nodes is problematic due to the inconsistencies in their cryptographic primitives. This paper introduces a new key management scheme that aims to establish session keys for highly resource-constrained nodes ensuring security protection through strong encryption and authentication means.

Nevertheless, current e-health systems are unable to run existing standardised key management protocols due to their limited energy power and computational capabilities.

Firstly, we propose a new header compression scheme to reduce the size of MIKEY's header from 12 Bytes to 3 Bytes in the best compression case. Secondly, we present a new exchange mode to reduce the number of exchanged messages from 6 to 4. We use a formal validation tool to evaluate and validate the security properties of our tailored MIKEY-Ticket protocol.

Designing these protocols is challenging, especially in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT). Indeed, the presence of heterogeneous and dynamic members within the collaborative groups usually involves resource constrained entities, which require energy-aware protocols to manage frequent arrivals and departures of members. Moreover, both fault tolerance and scalability are sought for sensitive and large collaborative groups. To address these challenges, we propose to enhance our previously proposed protocol (i.e. DBGK) with polynomial computations. In fact, our contribution in this paper, allows additional controllers to be included with no impact on storage cost regarding constrained members.

This interconnection generates a huge amount of private data, which needs to be processed, transferred, and stored. Using classical security solutions to ensure data confidentiality in this context is challenging. In fact, these solutions have to deal with high scalability requirements, heterogeneity of the involved building blocks, in addition to resources scarcity of the embedded devices such as energy and computational limitations. In this thesis, we investigate the issue of designing safe security protocols while taking into consideration IoT specificities. We proceed by studying the IoT concept, its applications, along with the different architectures and communication protocols. These latter are at the basis of any security protocol deployment. Then, we focus on the efforts of the research community by analyzing the existing state of the art approaches. Relying on the detected shortcomings, we propose four secure and energy-aware key management protocols to address the issue of establishing secure communication channels between IoT entities. To assess our protocols, we conduct an analysis using a formal validation tool to validate their security properties. Furthermore, we estimate both their computational and communication overhead to highlight energy savings. The obtained results prove the viability of our proposed solutions in the sensitive and constrained environment of IoT applications.",

Indeed, resources scarcity in such environment hinders the implementation of existing standard based protocols. Among these protocols, MIKEY (Multimedia Internet KEYing) aims at establishing security credentials between two com- municating entities. However, the existing MIKEY modes fail to meet IoT specificities. In particular, the pre-shared key mode is energy efficient, but suffers from severe scalability issues. On the other hand, asymmetric modes such as the public key mode are scalable, but are highly resource consuming. To address this issue, we combine two previously proposed approaches to introduce a new distributed MIKEY mode. Indeed, relying on a cooperative approach, a set of third parties is used to discharge the constrained nodes from heavy computational operations. Doing so, the pre-shared mode is used in the constrained part of the network, while the public key mode is used in the unconstrained part of the network. Preliminary results show that our proposed mode is energy preserving whereas its security properties are kept safe.",

        "Description": "Group key management protocols are crucial in establishing secured communication channels for collaborative IoT-based groups. The Internet of Things (IoT) dimension includes additional challenges. In fact, resource constrained members within dynamic and heterogeneous groups are unable to run existing group key protocols. Furthermore, these protocols need to be scalable and fault tolerant to suit growing and sensitive groups. To face these issues, we enhance our previously proposed protocol called Decentralized Batch-based Group Key protocol (DBGK). Using polynomial computation to secure data exchanges, we considerably improve its scalability, fault tolerance and collusion freeness properties. This gain is achieved thanks to the ability to include additional unconstrained members (controllers) while inducing a very limited cost on the constrained members. Furthermore, we include an energy preserving blockchain-based mechanism to authenticate group members credentials in a distributed manner. To assess our new protocol called DiStributed Batch-based Group Key protocol (DsBGK), we performed a detailed theoretical security analysis to evaluate its behaviour against well studied attacks in the literature. Furthermore, we validated this analysis using a formal validation tool. To evaluate DsBGK performances , we performed extensive simulations. We proceeded by comparing DsBGK in term of energy cost, first, with DBGK, then with other analogous protocols from the literature. The results confirmed the security soundness of DsBGK, in addition to an improved energy efficiency compared to its peers.",

However, due to the limited resource available in such systems and privacy concerns that might rise from the capture of personal data, security issues constitute a major obstacle to their deployment. Authentication of the different entities involved and data confidentiality constitute the main concerns for users that need to be addressed. In this paper, we propose a new key management scheme for an ehealth application to allow sensors and the Base Station (BS) to negotiate certain security credentials that will be used to protect the information flow. Our prtocol provides a strong level of security guaranteeing authentication and data confidentiality while the scarcity of resources is taken into consideration. The scheme is based on a lightweight Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) where the sensors have to perform only one Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) decryption in the key establishment process. Data exchanges are then secured by the use of symmetric encryption. In addition, Time Stamps are used to prevent replay attacks along with Message Code Authentication (MAC) to ensure integrity.",

These devices engage in continuous communication, with a significant aspect being group communications. Indeed, the latter are often more efficient than one-to-one interactions, rendering them well-suited for applications like e-health, federated learning, and military systems. However, security plays a pivotal role in these group communications, especially in safeguarding data confidentiality and user privacy. In this context, group key management protocols offer a mechanism for establishing shared group keys and updating them when needed. Nonetheless, the inherently asynchronous nature of IoT devices has proven to be a challenge. IoT devices are susceptible to unexpectedly entering an offline mode due to factors such as battery depletion, energy conservation, or loss of wireless connectivity. Consequently …",

It is clear that classical deterministic approaches might not be suitable to this complex and fast evolving environment. Hence, machine learning techniques with their ability to handle such a dynamic context, are rising in popularity. In particular, Federated Learning architectures which are better suited to the distributed nature of IoT and its privacy concerns.

In fact, we designed a score-based method relying on devices attributes and behavior making the system operational from the outset.

While there are several existing methods that include splitting the model into a collection of BP fragments before a multi-cloud deployment minimizing therefore the likelihood of a coalition, a risk still remains. We propose in this paper an approach for detecting malicious cloud providers that initiate or participate to a coalition. To do that, we rely on decoy processes having the same structure and number of data as a real process, but with decision strategy making as well as data sets that are completely different (fake) from the real one. Our objective is to detect unexpected exchanges of messages between malicious clouds, that may signify an attempt to initiate or participate to a coalition. The level of reputation of each cloud initiating or joining the coalition will be modified accordingly.",

        "Description": "A multi-agent system can be studied as a concurrent, asynchronous, stochastic and distributed computer system. These characteristics of multi-agent systems make them also a discrete-event dynamic system; it is, therefore, important to analyze the behavior of such system to ensure that it terminates correctly and satisfies other important properties. Several analytical methodologies have been used to study multi-agent system, particularly Petri nets. Petri nets have a well-defined mathematical structure that can be leveraged to provide formal analysis on discrete-event systems. In this work, we propose an automatic transformation to model multi-agent systems using Colored Petri nets.",

        "Description": "Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful tool for leveraging the vast quantities of data generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Its advantage lies in its ability to preserve participants’ data privacy through keeping it local. In addition, FL alleviates the communication overhead in cloud-centric ML for IoT approaches, through sharing model updates instead of large raw data, which optimizes bandwidth use. Furthermore, decentralized FL has been useful in addressing security concerns typical in conventional settings. Nevertheless, in such zero-trust scenarios where there is no central coordinator, nodes exhibit reluctance to participate due to the lack of clear rewards and trust issues. Additionally, constrained FL clients may abandon their tasks, which negatively impacts learning performance. In this paper, we propose a double-incentive FL approach to address the dual challenge of node reluctance and …",

        "Description": "Cloud computing has raised concerns about security, causing many companies to hesitate in adopting it. Despite these concerns, there are methods available to address the risks associated with implementing a business process (BP) in the cloud. One common approach involves breaking down the BP model into smaller fragments, allowing each cloud provider access to a specific part of the overall model. However, this method fails to protect against collaboration between malicious cloud providers, which, by pooling their knowledge, can exploit the logic of the process. To tackle this issue, our paper proposes an approach that effectively manages coalitions when they arise. To do this, we introduce observer and deceiver fragments, which play a crucial role in redirecting the process execution toward a fake task. This strategic redirection prevents access to important information. The obtained results demonstrate …",

To mitigate risks, they fragment processes across multiple cloud platforms, interconnected through synchronization messages and reinforced by separation constraints. Exploring machine learning techniques, particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), becomes essential for addressing optimization challenges in dynamic cloud environments, handling data flow, scalability, and security. This paper proposes leveraging Q-learning, a form of RL, for efficient task allocation in cloud computing. Unlike traditional methods, this approach ensures effective task assignment management in complex and evolving environments, reducing information overload per cloud.

However, as such processes express their know-how and because of the nature of the cloud, they are still reluctant to do so. Although some solutions already exist and consist in splitting the model into a collaboration of BP fragments for a deployment in a multi-cloud context, none of them takes into account the possibility of collusion between the clouds executing the different fragments. To address this issue, we propose in this paper an approach that introduces decoy processes, having the same structure of the real one with decision and synthesis strategy making that are completely different of those of the real process. The objective being to hide the execution of the real process even if a coalition actually happens. The approach is validated against an introduced …",

However, existing MIKEY modes fail to meet the requirements of low-power and low-processing devices. To address this issue, we combine two previously proposed approaches to introduce a new compressed and distributed MIKEY mode applied to a collaborative internet of things context. A set of third parties is used to discharge the constrained nodes from heavy computational operations. Doing so, the MIKEY pre-shared mode is used in the constrained part of network, while the public key mode is used in the unconstrained part of the network. Furthermore, to mitigate the communication cost we introduce a new header compression scheme that reduces the size of MIKEY's header from 12 bytes to 3 bytes in the best compression case. To assess our approach, we performed a detailed …",

        "Description": "Competitive Intelligence (CI) is the process of managing information emanating from the business environment of an organization in order to support decision making process. CI enables the development of strategies that confer companies a significant competitive advantage. The appropriate decisions are taken when all required data are considered. As the amount of data grows very fast inside and outside of an enterprise, exploiting these mountains of data efficiently became a crucial need. Note that such data are usually multiples, heterogeneous, autonomous and distributed. The main issue is related to the identification and resolution of structural and semantic heterogeneity between data, usually spread in multiple sources. Data integration is a significant solution that addresses these problems. Data Warehouse (DW) is viewed as Data Integration System (DIS) that consolidates several data sources in the …",

Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) phase plays a crucial role in designing DW. To overcome the complexity of the ETL phase, different studies have recently proposed the use of ontologies. Ontology-based ETL approaches have been used to reduce heterogeneity between data sources and ensure automation of the ETL process.

Designing data flows is facing several challenges. In this article, we deal with data quality issues such as (1) specifying a set of quality rules, (2) enforcing them on the data flow pipeline to detect violations, and (3) producing accurate repairs for the detected violations. We propose QDflows, a system for designing quality-aware data flows that considers the following as input: (1) a high-quality knowledge base (KB) as the global schema of integration, (2) a set of data sources and a set of validated users’ requirements, (3) a set of defined mappings between data sources and the KB, and (4) a set of quality rules specified by users.

        "Description": "In this paper, we present CSP-DC, a data cleaning system that integrates a new intelligent solution into the cleaning process to improve data accuracy, consistency, and minimize user involvement. We address three main challenges:(1) Consistency: Most repairing algorithms introduce new violations when repairing data, especially when constraints have overlapping attributes.(2) Automaticity: User intervention is time-consuming, we seek to minimize their efforts.(3) Accuracy: Most automatic approaches compute minimal repairs and apply unverified modifications to repair ambiguous cases, which may introduce more noise. To address these challenges, we propose to formulate this problem as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) allowing updates that always maintain data consistency. To achieve high performances, we perform a first cleaning phase to automatically repair violations that are easily handled by existing repair algorithms. We handle violations with multiple possible repairs with a CSP solving algorithm, which selects from possible fixes, values that respect all constraints. To reduce the problem’s complexity, we propose a new variables ordering technique and pruning strategies, allowing to optimize the repair search and find a solution quickly. Our experiments show that CSP-DC provides consistent and accurate repairs in a linear time, while also minimizing user intervention.",

Consequently, when dealing with an inconsistency, it becomes difficult to determine whether the data is dirty, the ICs or both. In this paper, we address three main challenges: (1) Uncertainty: Since both data and ICs could be dirty, it is difficult to detect the source of the inconsistency and how to repair it. We propose a new metric to evaluate the relevance degree of ICs (Functional Dependencies (FDs)). (2) ICs Accuracy: when repairing ICs, they could be transformed to overrefined ICs preventing errors detection or oversimplified ICs leading to clean data modification. We propose to extract possible FD repairs from association rules with limiting the number of LHS attributes to avoid overrefined FDs. Oversimplified FDs on the other hand, are avoided …",

        "Description": "In E-Learning, the selection of the pedagogical contents to teach and the organization of this content are two principal operations during the design of a course. The growth and the diversity of the informational resources used generate problems of diffusion, access, of classification and management. With the MEMORAe project, we deal with these problems and propose to answer them by using an ontology- based organisational memory. In this article, we describe how and why we exploit the formalism of Topic maps to represent the contents of a course organisational memory and the TMQL standard to interrogate it.",

C’est le degré de la prise en charge du profil de l’apprenant. Ainsi, il est important de concevoir un dispositif mettant en œuvre une série d’évaluations. Nous pensons que l’évaluation, dans sa fonction formative, est au cœur de l’apprentissage vu sa fonction régulatrice qui est primordiale.Summary: In this paper, we will present a problematic that we judge important to take in consideration during the development of a training environment that correspond to the degree of taking account of the learner profile. So, it is important to have a module determined with a set of assessments. We think that the evaluation, in its formative function, is the center of learning process since its regulation function is very important.",

By analysing various aspects of individual and group processes from both the qualitative and the quantitative perspectives, it is possible to identify weaknesses of the course design and allow for adjustment and fine tuning. This work presents a model for analysing CSCL processes and consists of five dimensions: participation, interaction, social presence, cognitive presence and teaching presence. The model extends and combines the work of Henri (1992) and Garrison & Anderson (2003). Practical examples of the model application are reported in the context of pre-service teacher training.",

Internet, and in particular the World Wide Web, is becoming a learning space which is used increasingly in several educational contexts from secondary schools to post graduate courses. Learners can choose to take training modules and, in some cases, entire programs through the Net; the on line environment may be the only possibility to acquire knowledge on some topics for learners who do not have the opportunity to attend traditional classes; besides the communicative power of Internet tools can allow the activation of new ways of teaching/learning. As the number of on line learners is increasing, it is crucial for training centers and institutions to create effective on-line learning environments according to the specific needs of each learner. In fact, a lot of aspects have to be taken into account to project and activate a good distance course: effective presentation of contents, consideration of individual differences of users, adoption of several models according to educational objectives, and so on.",

        "Description": "Palmprint is one of the modalities that offer high recognition accuracy. The recognition process depends on an optimized ROI (Region of Interest) extraction. This extraction is affected by several factors including the device used and the acquisition conditions. The acquisition mode can alter some image properties like rotation, translation and scale. Some devices are designed to maintain hand in a fixed position and delimit a subspace of the hand. On the other hand, contactless devices offer more convenience and flexibility but lead to altered images. ROI extraction methods must consider the acquisition device (with contact or contactless). In this paper, we propose a ROI extraction method that addresses this issue. We test our method on two databases PolyU and CASIA which illustrate the impact of using contactless device unlike the PolyU device. Then, we test performances of the palmprint biometric system.

In this paper, we propose a multi-biometrics scheme and we apply the cross validation between two databases to study the Equal Error Rate improvement of score level fusion. Our fusion function is constructed using an evolutionary GA on the XM2VTS score database. The best one is tested on a sub-sequence of the BioSecure Score database. As this database offers quality measurement, we transform our function into a weighted function with user-specific approach to study performance enhancement with quality integration. The results are significantly improved with a high confidence and quality measurement becomes inherent to reduce recognition errors. ",

        "Description": "Multibiometric systems are a promising area that addresses a number of unimodal biometric systems drawbacks. The main limit of these systems is the lack of information in terms of quantity (number of discriminant features) and quality (diversity of information, correlation…). Using multiple sources of information and/or treatment is a solution to overcome these problems and enhance system performances. Performance requirements of current systems related to context use involve designed solutions that optimally satisfy security requirements. This can represent an optimization problem that aims at searching the optimal solution matching security needs. In our study, we are interested in combining different score level rules using an evolutionary algorithm. We use Genetic Algorithm to derive a score fusion function based on primitive operations. The process uses an optimized tree to determine function …",

The authors analyse fusion efficiency of a significant number of multi‐biometric fusion schemes. To do so, the study applies different functions that are generated using genetic programming (GP) on the 2000 multi‐biometric instances produced by the fusion of different biometric matching scores. The functions are represented using a tree of arithmetic operations and are used for fusion at score level. First, genetic programming is implemented on the XM2VTS score database. The GP optimizes the half total error rate of fused matching scores. Then, a comparative study is performed based on our experiments on matching scores of different biometric baseline systems provided by the bio‐secure database. This database provides 24 streams that we use to generate 2000 multi‐biometric combinations. These multi‐biometric …",

Chaff-points generation process consists of creating a set of chaff points similar to authentic minutiae feature representation. Squares based chaff-points generation consist of delimiting a square boundary around each chaff-point in such a way that a square must never overlap with other squares. Unlike the typical squares method where chaff-points and their boundaries are generated sequentially, in our proposal, the referred chaff-points are generated all together then the knapsack problem formulation is used along with 0/1 dynamic programing resolution to determine if each chaff-point respects the constraints. The experiments results show that the chaff-points generation based on Knapsack method generates the referred number of chaff-points …",

This extraction is affected by several factors including the device used and the acquisition conditions. The acquisition step can alter some image properties like rotation, translation and scale. Some devices are designed to maintain hand in a fixed position and delimit a subspace of the hand. On the other hand, contactless devices offer more convenience and flexibility but lead to altered images. ROI extraction methods must consider the acquisition device (with contact or contactless). In this paper, we propose palmprint recognition system considering this issue. A ROI extraction method is implemented and tested on different databases taking into account the acquisition device with different sensor conditions. Our research to test this method, are conducted on …",

It is used to maintain the PV operating point at its maximum under different temperatures and sunlight irradiations. The goal of a MPPT controller is to satisfy the following performances criteria: accuracy, precision, speed, robustness and handling the partial shading problem when climatic changes variations occur. To achieve this goal, several techniques have been proposed ranging from conventional methods to artificial intelligence and bio-inspired methods. Each technique has its own advantage and disadvantage. In this context, we propose in this paper, a new Bio- inspired MPPT controller based on the Ant colony Optimization algorithm with a New Pheromone Updating strategy (ACO_NPU MPPT) that saves the computation time and performs an excellent tracking capability with high accuracy, zero …",

This problem is of crucial importance in the field of social network analysis. The goal of our paper is to classify existing methods dealing with the issue. We propose a classification of various methods for tracking community evolution in dynamic social networks into four main approaches using as a criterion the functioning principle: the first one is based on independent successive static detection and matching; the second is based on dependent successive static detection; the third is based on simultaneous study of all stages of community evolution; finally, the fourth and last one concerns methods working directly on temporal networks. Our paper starts by giving basic concepts about social networks, community structure and strategies for evaluating community detection …",

        "Description": "Enabling compilers to automatically optimize code has been a longstanding goal for the compiler community. Efficiently solving this problem requires using precise cost models. These models predict whether applying a sequence of code transformations reduces the execution time of the program. Building an analytical cost model to do so is hard in modern x86 architectures due to the complexity of the microarchitecture. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning based cost model for automatic code optimization. This model was integrated in a search method and implemented in the Tiramisu compiler to select the best code transformations. The input of the proposed model is a set of simple features representing the unoptimized code and a sequence of code transformations. The model predicts the speedup expected when the code transformations are applied. Unlike previous models, the proposed one works on full programs and does not rely on any heavy feature engineering. The proposed model has only 16% of mean absolute percentage error in predicting speedups on full programs. The proposed model enables Tiramisu to automatically find code transformations that match or are better than state-of-the-art compilers without requiring the same level of heavy feature engineering required by those compilers",

The numerous constraints imposed by the environment and/or the underlying target architecture of mixed systems (containing hardware and software parts) make these two problems hard to solve. This paper introduces an automatic approach that integrates simultaneously partitioning and scheduling. It is inspired by the collective behavior of social insects such as bees in order to find a feasible solution to partitioning, using scheduling to find the shortest execution time to the system under design.",

We consider in this paper the Shortest Path routing Tree (SPT) problem in WSN under different metrics; we show that the basic SPT based strategies are unsuitable for the many-to-one WSN when considering some metrics to compute link costs. Indeed, existing SPT approaches aim to construct a tree rooted at the sink such that the cost of the path from any node to the sink is minimal, while the cost of a given path is computed as summation of the costs of links that compose this path. However, in many-to-one WSN, links which are close to the sink are more critical than other links when using some metrics. We propose in this paper a new weighted path cost function, and we show that our cost function is more suitable for WSN. Based on this cost function, we propose a simple and efficient weighted shortest path tree construction …",

It is considered as a hard optimization problem and metaheuristics give very satisfactory results for such problems. In this work, we propose a hybrid metaheuristic that integrates a reinforcement learning algorithm with Bee Swarm Optimization metaheuristic (BSO) for solving feature selection problem. QBSO-FS follows the wrapper approach. It uses a hybrid version of BSO with Q-learning for generating feature subsets and a classifier to evaluate them. The goal of using Q-learning is to benefit from the advantage of reinforcement learning to make the search process more adaptive and more efficient. The performances of QBSO-FS are evaluated on 20 well-known datasets and the results are compared with those of original BSO and other recently published methods. The results show that …",

In this paper, we introduce Adaptive and dual Data-Communication Trust scheme (ADCT) for clustered wireless sensor networks to effectively deal with untrustworthy nodes. Unlike prior works, we propose an adaptive trust function to assess the direct trust between nodes according to the application’s requirement in terms of trust severity. We also consider data trust to cope with untrustworthy nodes during the data collection despite their communication capabilities.

Our experiments on DBLP and Facebook datasets, using community structural features and its influential members' features, confirm that the prediction of the next event that may occur to an evolving community using change rates of features can be achieved with a very high accuracy. We further observe that the most significant features vary according to each event prediction.",

Our main contribution is to propose game modeling that allows decision maker to have compromise solutions meeting at best production and maintenance criteria. To achieve this, two new games formulations for the problem are proposed, and a stable solution for the players is obtained through the concept of equilibrium. The first game follows a constructive approach while the second one follows an improvement one. Moreover, to cope with the concept of game types, we proposed two player’s behaviors: rational and non-rational. Extensive experiments are carried out to validate our proposed approaches and developed methods.

Because of large amount of features in real world applications, feature selection is considered as a hard optimization problem. For such problems, metaheuristics have been shown to be a very promising solving approach. In this work, we propose to use Bee Swarm Optimization (BSO) for feature selection. The proposed algorithm, BSO-FS, is based on the wrapper approach that uses BSO for the generation of feature subsets, and a classifier algorithm to evaluate the solutions. BSO-FS is tested on well-known datasets and its performances are compared with those of recently published methods. Obtained results show that for the majority of datasets, BSO-FS selects efficiently relevant features while improving the classification accuracy.",

LAHC is an iterative list-based single-parameter metaheuristic that exploits information from one iteration to another to decide whether the new candidate solution is accepted. A dynamic job insertion heuristic is used to generate initial solutions. Three local search operators (job swap between different machines, job swap within the same machine and job insertion from one machine to another) are used to improve solutions. A Variable Neighborhood Descent (VND) method is proposed to improve the candidate solution and accelerate the convergence of the LAHC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of LAHC to parallel machine scheduling problems. We evaluate and compare the proposed algorithm against the best …",

To start with, the dynamic network is split into a series of timeframes, each one containing interactions aggregated over a time period such as a month, a day or an hour. Splitting the network into timeframes is of crucial importance to capture the right communities' temporal evolution before predicting their future. Our paper investigates the problem of choosing the appropriate scale for network splitting which would improve the prediction. The experiments we conducted on Facebook and Higgs Twitter datasets offer strong empirical evidence of the usefulness of considering the appropriate network splitting as a first step in predicting community evolution in dynamic social networks.",

        "Description": "Programmers spend a lot of time and effort optimizing their code to make it run faster, this has led compiler researchers to focus on developing automatic optimization techniques that allow to automatically improve program performance. Such techniques aim to transform programs to exploit more efficiently the underlying hardware. Efficient implementations of automatic optimization techniques require precise cost models, they evaluate whether applying a sequence of code transformations reduces the execution time of the program. Building an analytical cost model to do so is hard in modern x86 architectures due to the complexity of the microarchitecture. In this work, we present a novel deep learning-based cost model for automatic code optimization. This cost model is integrated into an auto-scheduler that enables Tiramisu compiler to select the best code transformations for a given program. The input of the proposed model is a tree-structured set of high-level features representing the unoptimized code along with a sequence of code transformations, the cost model predicts the speedup expected when the code transformations are applied. To train the model, we built a 1.8 million points dataset consisting of transformed synthetic Tiramisu programs. The proposed model achieves a low error rate of 16% MAPE on predicting speedups. Furthermore, the model is proven effective at ranking code transformation candidates with an nDCG score of 98%. Experiments on real-world image processing, deep learning, and scientific computing programs show that the auto-scheduler finds competitive solutions 95 times faster when it uses the proposed cost …",

It consists of a high-level genetic algorithm which goal is to tailor a dedicated and effective genetic algorithm for each instance. The goal of the proposed hyper-heuristic is to find among a set of genetic operators, a configuration that is suitable for solving a PFSP problem instance and compare the tailored GAs to investigate the existence of any patterns. Our experiments on well-known Taillard’s benchmark showed the performance of tailored GAs. HHGA was able to build genetic algorithms that reached optimal solutions in 50 instances out of 120 and was at least as good as state-of-the-art approaches. Through results, we show also the performance of some operators compared to others.",

        "Description": "This paper proposes a three-phase metaheuristic-based approach for induction machine bearing failure detection and diagnosis. It consists of extracting and processing different failure types features to set up a knowledge base, which contains different failure types. The first phase consists in pre-processing the measured signals by aggregating them and preparing the data in exploitable formats for the clustering. The second phase ensures the induction machine operating mode diagnosis. A measured signals clustering is performed to build classes where each one represents a health state. A variable neighborhood search (VNS) metaheuristic is designed for data clustering. Moreover, VNS is hybridized with a classical mechanics-inspired optimization (CMO) metaheuristic to balance global exploration and local exploitation during the evolutionary process. The third phase consists of two-step failure detection, setting up a knowledge base containing different failure types, and defining a representative model for each failure type. In the learning step, different class features are extracted and inserted in the knowledge base to be used during the decision step. The proposed metaheuristic-based failure detection diagnosis approach is evaluated using PRONOSTIA and CWR bearing data experimental platforms vibration and temperature measurements. The achieved results clearly demonstrate the failure detection and diagnosis, efficiency, and effectiveness of the proposed metaheuristic approach.",

However, such tools are confronted to a particular problem: the great number of characteristics that qualify data samples. They are more or less victims of the abundance of information. Sat domain benefits from the appearance of powerful solvers that can process huge amounts of data in short times. This paper proposes to solve supervised learning problems expressed as Sat ones. This is done to take advantage of an existing environment that allows experimenting different heuristics, such as: tabu search, genetic algorithm, ant colonies, etc., in order to extract solutions that satisfy a maximum number of clauses (Max-Sat problem). Finally, the best solutions are back-translated into rules that are applied to the data sets in order to verify that they really satisfy a …",

However, they are time consuming mainly due to the growing size of databases. To speed up this process, we propose two parallel GAs (ARMGPU and ARM-CPU/GPU). In ARM-GPU, parallelism is used to compute the fitness which is the most time consuming task; while, ARM-CPU/GPU proposes a two-level-based parallel GA. In the first level, the different cores of the CPU execute a GAARM on a sub-population. The second level of parallelism is used to compute the fitness, in parallel, on GPU. To validate the proposed two parallel GAs, several tests were conducted to solve well-known large ARM instances. Obtained results show that our parallel algorithms outperform state-of-the-art exact algorithms (APRIORI and FP-GROWTH) and approximate algorithms (SEGPU and ME-GPU) in terms of execution time.",

Studies on tracking and predicting community evolution generally split these networks into time-series of static networks, each including interactions aggregated over discrete time intervals (hours, days, and years). This choice of intervals is very often done arbitrarily. Yet, it is clear that the selection of the time interval over which the network is discretized has a great impact on the observation of community structures, the analysis of their evolution, and the prediction of their future events. In this paper, we propose a new framework that examines users’ activity distribution over time to provide the appropriate network splitting that would produce more accurate community event prediction.

        "Description": "Palmprint is one of the modalities that offer high recognition accuracy. The recognition process depends on an optimized ROI (Region of Interest) extraction. This extraction is affected by several factors including the device used and the acquisition conditions. The acquisition mode can alter some image properties like rotation, translation and scale. Some devices are designed to maintain hand in a fixed position and delimit a subspace of the hand. On the other hand, contactless devices offer more convenience and flexibility but lead to altered images. ROI extraction methods must consider the acquisition device (with contact or contactless). In this paper, we propose a ROI extraction method that addresses this issue. We test our method on two databases PolyU and CASIA which illustrate the impact of using contactless device unlike the PolyU device. Then, we test performances of the palmprint biometric system.

Segmentation can be seen as a combinatorial optimization problem. In fact, considering the huge amount of information that an image carries, it is impossible to find the best segmentation. On the other hand, the reduced individual properties of ants as well as the simplicity of their behaviours led to the design of several methods of optimization by ants such as: optimization by colony of ants (ant colony optimization) and classification by co-operating ants (AntClass, AntTree, AntClust...). In this paper, we present an algorithm for the resolution of the segmentation problem. This algorithm, named ISA (image segmentation using ants), is based on the behavior of ants while cleaning their nest. The image to be segmented represents the …",

The motivation of this work is to reduce the time needed to design a dedicated genetic algorithm for a new instance increasing the chance to explore undiscovered search spaces. It uses three search spaces to build genetic algorithms. In the first one, standard blind operators are used. In the second one, problem-oriented ones are used and finally, in the last one, knowledge extracted during the search process is taken into consideration through diversification and intensification strategies. H H A B S’s solving process explores the three search spaces starting from the standard one and jumps to the next search spaces until it gets the best found solution so far, for the given instance, or all search spaces are covered …",

Selecting a priori the best metaheuristic for a given instance is a difficult task which can be addressed using meta-learning. In this work, we propose a method to recommend, for a MaxSAT instance, the best metaheuristic among three: Genetic Algorithm (GA), Bee Swarm Optimization (BSO) and Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP). Basically, a learning model is trained to induce associations between MaxSAT instances’ characteristics and metaheuristics’ performances. The built model is able to select the best metaheuristic for a new MaxSAT instance. We experiment different learning algorithms on different instances from several benchmarks. Experimental results show that the best metaheuristic is selected with a prediction rate exceeding 80% regardless …",

From an algorithmic point of view, memes have come to be regarded as building-blocks of prior knowledge, expressed in arbitrary computational representations (e.g., local search heuristics, fuzzy rules, neural models, etc.), that have been acquired through experience by a human or machine, and can be imitated (i.e., reused) across problems.\n\nThe Memetic Computing journal welcomes papers incorporating the aforementioned socio-cultural notion of memes into artificial systems, with particular emphasis on enhancing the efficacy of computational and artificial intelligence techniques for search, optimization, and machine learning through explicit prior knowledge incorporation. The goal of the journal is to thus be an outlet for high quality theoretical and applied research on hybrid, knowledge-driven computational approaches that may be characterized under any of the following categories of memetics:\n\nType 1: General-purpose algorithms integrated with human-crafted heuristics that capture some form of prior domain knowledge; e.g., traditional memetic algorithms hybridizing evolutionary global search with a problem-specific local search.\nType 2: Algorithms with the ability to automatically select, adapt, and reuse the most appropriate heuristics from a diverse pool of available choices; e.g., learning a mapping between global search operators and multiple local search schemes, given an optimization problem at hand.\nType 3: Algorithms that autonomously learn with experience, adaptively reusing data and/or machine learning models drawn from related problems as prior knowledge in new target tasks of interest; examples include, but are not limited to, transfer learning and optimization, multi-task learning and optimization, or any other multi-X evolutionary learning and optimization methodologies.",

Unlike prior works, we propose an adaptive function to evaluate the direct trust between nodes according to the need of the application in terms of trust severity. We also consider data trust to cope with untrustworthy nodes during the data collection despite their communication capabilities. Finally, we introduce a new method to discard a malicious recommendation when building feedback at the base station or cluster-head level. Theoretical analysis shows that our trust mechanism allows a good trade-off between memory requirement and trust cooperation.",

With the evolution of Semantic Web services (SWs) within organizations and their uses in a large-scale, composition of services in a distributed setting has become a real challenge.

Their modelling and simulation requires the use on the one hand of a suited technology that is multi-agent systems (MASs) to model the various actors of a market, and on the other hand the evolutionary game theory to formalise interactions and heterogeneous investment strategies. The goal of this paper is to model, simulate and analyse financial markets dynamics. For this purpose, we propose three market models (fundamentalist, strategic, conventionalist) summarising various facets of real market speculation depending on the information held and the price formation process chosen by the investors. Each model is built using a multi-agent system. Moreover, investors’ agents are modelled by classifier systems that are advanced structures to study their evolutionary and adaptive aspects.",

This paper introduces an automatic approach using genetic algorithms to solve partitioning in codesign. This approach is totally independent of target architecture.

Results obtained on synthetic and real-word networks show that the proposed algorithm can discover communities more successfully in comparison with traditional ABC algorithm and other state-of-the-art algorithms.",

        "Description": "Choices of decision makers in a basketball team are not limited to the strategies to be adopted during games. The most important ones are outside the field and concern team composition and talented and productive players to acquire on which the team can rely to raise its game level. In this paper, we propose to use data mining tasks to help decision makers to make appropriate decisions that will lead to the improvement of the performance of their players and their team. Tasks such as clustering, classification and regression are used to detect weaknesses of a team; best players that can help overcome these weaknesses; predict performance and salaries of players. These will be done on the NBA dataset.",

It proposes the use of a new Classical Mechanics-inspired Optimization (CMO) metaheuristic for data clustering. To ensure failure detection, transitions from a state to another is analyzed in order to form a transitional model between system states generated by the clustering. The performances of the proposed new metaheuristic are evaluated on the PRONOSTIA experimental platform data.",

In this paper, we propose a multi-biometrics scheme and we apply the cross validation between two databases to study the Equal Error Rate improvement of score level fusion. Our fusion function is constructed using an evolutionary GA on the XM2VTS score database. The best one is tested on a sub-sequence of the BioSecure Score database. As this database offers quality measurement, we transform our function into a weighted function with user-specific approach to study performance enhancement with quality integration. The results are significantly improved with a high confidence and quality measurement becomes inherent to reduce recognition errors. ",

The main limit of these systems is the lack of information in terms of quantity (number of discriminant features) and quality (diversity of information, correlation…). Using multiple sources of information and/or treatment is a solution to overcome these problems and enhance system performances. Performance requirements of current systems related to context use involve designed solutions that optimally satisfy security requirements. This can represent an optimization problem that aims at searching the optimal solution matching security needs. In our study, we are interested in combining different score level rules using an evolutionary algorithm. We use Genetic Algorithm to derive a score fusion function based on primitive operations. The process uses an optimized tree to determine function …",

In this approach, we define a distributed solution based on epidemic discovery algorithm to achieve a specific goal through the distributed discovery of SWs in P2P networks.

        "Description": "B&B algorithms are well known techniques for exact solving of combinatorial optimization problems (COP). They perform an implicit enumeration of the search space instead of exhaustive one. Based on a pruning technique, they reduce considerably the computation time required to explore the whole search space. Nevertheless, these algorithms remain inefficient when dealing with large combinatorial optimization instances. They are time-intensive and they require a huge computing power to be solved optimally. Nowadays, multi-core-based processors and GPU accelerators are often coupled together to achieve impressive performances. However, classical B&B algorithms must be rethought to deal with their two divergent architectures. In this paper, we propose a new B&B approach exploiting both the multi-core aspect of actual processors and GPU accelerators. The proposed approaches have been executed …",

        "Description": "While polyhedral compilers have shown success in implementing advanced code transformations, they still have challenges in selecting the most profitable transformations that lead to the best speedups. This has motivated the use of machine learning to build cost models to guide the search for polyhedral optimizations. State-of-the-art polyhedral compilers have demonstrated a viable proof-of-concept of this approach. While such a proof-of-concept has shown promise, it still has significant limitations. State-of-the-art polyhedral compilers that use a deep-learning cost model only support a small subset of affine transformations, limiting their ability to apply complex code transformations. They also only support simple programs that have a single loop nest and a rectangular iteration domain, limiting their applicability to many programs. These limitations significantly impact the generality of such compilers and autoschedulers and put into question the whole approach. In this paper, we introduce LOOPer, the first polyhedral autoscheduler that uses a deep-learning based cost model and covers a large set of affine transformations and programs. It supports the exploration of a large set of affine transformations, allowing the application of complex sequences of polyhedral transformations. It also supports the optimization of programs with multiple loop nests and with rectangular and non-rectangular iteration domains, allowing the optimization of an extensive set of programs. We implement and evaluate LOOPer and show that it achieves speedups over the state-of-the-art. On the Polybench benchmark, LOOPer achieves a geometric mean speedup of 1 …",

        "Description": "Association rules mining (ARM) is an unsupervised learning task. It is used to generate significant and relevant association rules among items in a database. APRIORI and FP-GROWTH are the most popular and used algorithms nowadays for extracting such rules. They are exact methods that consist of two phases. First, frequent itemsets are generated. Then, the latter are used to generate rules. The main drawback of both algorithms is their high execution time. To overcome this drawback, metaheuristics have been proposed. Moreover, to optimize the execution time, since the amount of data is in continuous growth, some parallel architectures can be found in the literature. In this paper, we present an overview of existing literature that investigate the ARM problem using both metaheuristics and parallelism. We will focus on the recent algorithms that tackle these problems using approximate methods and …",

In this paper, we consider two objectives: reduce the number of frequencies and the interference caused by the violation of the network constraints. We use a new model based on a set-T-colouring graph which takes in consideration all constraints related to cellular network. We propose to use an evolutionary metaheuristic, biogeography-based multi-objective optimisation algorithm (BBMO), to solve the considered problem. As it is a bi-objective approach, our results are represented by a set of non-dominated solutions based on the definition of Pareto optimum front. A framework to study and measure the quality of the obtained Pareto fronts based on six performance indicators (ONVGR, HV, Spread, GS, GD, IGD) has been implemented. The obtained …",

Each sub-population can be seen as a population on which a GA is applied. Hence, we propose two GAs, a sequential one and a parallel one.

This paper proposes a new fully adaptive routing protocol for 2D-mesh NoC. It is inspired from the A-star search algorithm and called HRA (Heuristic based Routing Algorithm). The latter is distributed, congestion-aware and fault-tolerant by using only the local information of each router neighbors. HRA does not use VCs (Virtual Channels) but tries to reduce the risk of deadlock by avoiding the 2-nodes and the 4-nodes loops. Results show that HRA ensures a good reliability rate despite of the presence of many faulty links. In addition, it has interesting latencies values in different NoC sizes.",

        "Description": "Hyper-heuristics can be applied to solve complex optimization problems. However, they need a substantial number of fitness function evaluations to discover a good approximation to the global optimum, especially for large-scale problems. Recently, surrogate-assisted algorithms have drawn increasing attention, and have shown their potential to deal with expensive complex optimization problems. This paper aims to use surrogates to approximate HHGA's (Ahmed Bacha et al., 2019) fitness functions, an efficient hyper-heuristic for solving the permutation flowshop problem, one of the most important scheduling types in modern industries. The objective is to approximate, in an online approach, the fitness function, reducing considerably the execution time of HHGA while maintaining its quality. The proposed online surrogate model is mainly designed to capture the details of the fitness function to enhance the …",

The second uses Frequent itemset mining for guiding the search process to promising solutions.

In this paper, we develop a new hybrid bi-objective genetic and parallel variable neighborhood descent algorithm (GA-PVNS) to determine close to optimal configurations for heterogeneous FPGA-based MPSoC (Ht-MPSoC). Our exploration method aims to optimize simultaneously two objectives, namely area on the FPGA and execution time, taking advantage of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) diversification ability and the intensification provided by Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) algorithm.

In the literature, there are mainly two dual approaches, namely the region-based segmentation and the edge-based segmentation. In this article, we propose to take advantage of Game theory in image segmentation by results fusion. Thus, the presented game is cooperative in a way that both players represented by the two segmentation modules (region-based and edge-based) try coalitionary to enhance the value of a common characteristic function. This is a variant of the parallel decision-making procedure based on Game theory proposed by Chakraborty and Duncan [1]. The involved pixels are those generated from the cooperation by results fusion between the edge detector (Active contour) and the region detector (Region …",

We first present two ACS new strategies (ACS1 and ASC2) and an MBO approach (BeesCol) for the GCP, then, we offer several collaboration modes and parallelisation for the proposed methods using a parallel machine simulated on a cluster of PCs. An empirical study is undertaken for each method. Moreover, to test our approach, we have also implemented effective algorithms for the GCP. A comparison between the different algorithms shows that ACS1 (construction strategy) gives best results and is quite fast compared to other methods.

The approach we adopt is based on agent technology, particularly multi-agent systems. Each driver is represented by a software agent. A virtual environment is used to simulate drivers’ behaviour, thus enabling us to observe the conditions leading to road rage. The simulated model is then used to suggest possible ways of alleviating this societal problem. Our agents are equipped with an emotional module which will make their behaviours more human-like. For this, we propose a computational emotion model based on the OCC model and probabilistic cognitive maps. The key influencing factors that are included in the model are personality, emotions and some social/personal attributes.",

However, such tools are confronted to a particular problem: the great number of characteristics that qualify data samples. They are more or less victims of the abundance of information.Sat domain benefits from the appearance of powerful solvers that can process huge amounts of data in short times. This paper presents an approach for translating timetable problems (which are a particular case of DSS), into a Boolean formula, which is then provided to an environment that allows experimenting different heuristics in order to extract solutions that satisfy a maximum number of clauses (Max-Sat problem). Finally, the best solutions are back-translated into the original problem in order to find an adequate schedule that satisfies the characteristics and constraints of the timetable problem.",

It is an NP-Complete problem that deals with the different constraints relative to the system and the underlying target architecture. The existing partitioning approaches have a major drawback: they are generally dedicated to particular classes of applications and/or target architectures and this makes them difficult to generalize as soon as small changes are performed on the system under design. Besides, it is generally difficult to include new strategies that might be better suited to the applications to partition. This paper introduces a parallel environment that offers the user the opportunity to describe, experiment new heuristics and test different sets of parameters. It is also possible to explore new hybridization schemes between different strategies.",

        "Description": "Monitoring pollution plumes is a key issue, given the harmful effects they cause. The dynamic of these plumes, which may be important due to meteorological conditions, makes their study difficult. Real-time monitoring in order to obtain an accurate mapping of the pollution dispersion is helpful and valuable to mitigate risks. In this work, we consider a fleet of cooperative drones carrying pollution sensors and operating in order to assess a pollution plume. The latter is assumed to follow a Gaussian process (GP) with varying parameters. For this use case, we propose an efficient approach to characterize spatially and temporarily the plume while optimizing the path planning of drones. In our approach, drones are guided by a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model called the categorical deep    -network (Categorical DQN) to maximize the plume coverage while considering budget constraints. Specifically, we develop a …",

Community evolution prediction is one of the most interesting issues in the field of social network analysis. It is usually handled by following four main steps:(1) split the network into timeframes;(2) detect communities in each timeframe;(3) track their evolutionary behavior and (4) build a predictive model to forecast the future events. The main objective of EPredictor is to provide a flexible environment that handles the entire process of community evolution prediction with a rich set of literature methods for each step; thus enabling researchers to make valuable comparisons and consistent analysis.",

Like most of recognition systems, palmprint one is composed of three steps: preprocessing, features extraction and representation and finally features matching. Minutiae are the most reliable and discriminating features used in these systems. Minutiae matching is then very critical. Quantifying the similarity between two sets of extracted minutiae and assigning a score is particularly important in this step. In this paper, we designed similarity scores for a minutiae based recognition system using a minimum of extracted information. Our proposed scores are based on the score of [1], used in point pattern matching. They are tested and compared on the database used in [2]. The best one is tested and compared to the one presented in the same work [2]. Obtained results …",

To make the simulation realistic enough, virtual characters need to express emotions according to the environment and deal with those emotions in a parallel way where an emotional experience can be triggered at the same time as another emotional response. The virtual character will have perceptions, feel and express emotions and respond to different situations. To make the simulation realistic, we used a method allowing the virtual characters to execute tasks, perceive events and display emotions in a parallel way. To do that, we used the multiple resources model [1] to control the attention and to predict when two or more actions can be executed at the same time. The used emotional model is based on Scherer's theory [2]. However, in this paper we focus on the …",

It is also the first time that ACII has been run under the auspices of the Association for the Advancement of Affective Computing, the successor to the old Humaine Association.\n\nFittingly, ACII returns to China this year. The program shows how strikingly the subject has progressed. It covers subjects that emerged early on, including affect and psychophysiology, affect in speech, machine learning, and Human—Machine Interaction. Other topics became central as the field developed: multimodal perception, affect induction for database construction, and affect in computer gaming. Beyond those are topics that are emerging onto the scene, reflecting more nuanced conceptions of emotion: dynamic signals of affect, emotion and cognition, skilled affective communication, affect and health, and laughter.

We first study the impact of a random data selection approach that renews the selected examples periodically during training. We find that random selection should be considered as a serious option as it allows high energy gains with small accuracy losses. Unexpectedly, it even outperforms a more elaborate approach in some cases.Our study of the random approach conducted us to observe that low selectivity ratios allow important energy savings, but also cause a significant accuracy decrease. To mitigate the effect of such ratios on the prediction quality, we propose to use a dynamic selectivity ratio with a decreasing schedule, that can be integrated to any selection approach. Our first results show that using such a schedule provides around 60% energy gains on the CIFAR-10 dataset with less than 1 …",

        "Description": "In this paper, we present a work in progress about a deep learning based approach for automatic code optimization in polyhedral compilers. The proposed technique explores combinations of affine and non-affine loop transformations to find the sequence of transformations that minimizes the execution time of a given program. This exploration is guided by a deep learning based cost model that evaluates the speedup that each sequence of transformations would yield. Preliminary results show that the proposed techniques achieve a 2.35x geometric mean speedup over state of the art polyhedral compilers (Pluto).",

The authors analyse fusion efficiency of a significant number of multi‐biometric fusion schemes. To do so, the study applies different functions that are generated using genetic programming (GP) on the 2000 multi‐biometric instances produced by the fusion of different biometric matching scores. The functions are represented using a tree of arithmetic operations and are used for fusion at score level. First, genetic programming is implemented on the XM2VTS score database. The GP optimizes the half total error rate of fused matching scores. Then, a comparative study is performed based on our experiments on matching scores of different biometric baseline systems provided by the bio‐secure database. This database provides 24 streams that we use to generate 2000 multi‐biometric combinations. These multi‐biometric …",

The quantity and quality of identity information extracted from EEG determine the performance of the EEG-based biometric system. In this paper, we evaluate the loss in identity information through different signal segmentation scenarios using Autoregressive model and K-Nearest Neighbor classifier. Our objective is to find some criteria linked to data segmentation allowing to reduce as far as possible the simulated loss of identity information. Experiments were conducted on EEG publicly available datasets collected in resting state for both opened and closed eyes. Results show that overlapped segmentation with longer segments’ length stands the best to the simulated loss favoring larger percentages of overlap.",

To integrate these relations in the mining process, SDM uses two main approaches: Static approach that integrates spatial relationships in a preprocessing phase, and dynamic approach that takes into consideration the spatial relationship during the process. In this work, we are interested in this last approach. Our proposition consists on taking into consideration the spatial component in the similarity measure. We propose two similarity measures; , . We will use those distances on the main task of SDM, spatial clustering, particularly on K-means algorithm. Moreover, a comparaison between these two approaches and other methods of clustering will be given. The tests are conducted on Boston dataset with 590 objects.",

Chaff-points generation process consists of creating a set of chaff points similar to authentic minutiae feature representation. Squares based chaff-points generation consist of delimiting a square boundary around each chaff-point in such a way that a square must never overlap with other squares. Unlike the typical squares method where chaff-points and their boundaries are generated sequentially, in our proposal, the referred chaff-points are generated all together then the knapsack problem formulation is used along with 0/1 dynamic programing resolution to determine if each chaff-point respects the constraints. The experiments results show that the chaff-points generation based on Knapsack method generates the referred number of chaff-points …",

For this, a subset of image pixels is regularly selected as planets and the rest as satellites. The attraction force is defined by Newton’s third law (gravitational interaction) according to the distance and color similarity. In the first phase of the algorithm, we seek an equilibrium state of the earth-moon system in order to achieve the second phase, in which we search an equilibrium state of the earth-apple system. As a result of these two phases, bodies in space are constructed; they represent segments in the image. The objective of this simulation is to find and then extract the multiple segments from an image. ",

The goal is to optimize two criteria simultaneously: minimization of total completion time (makespan) for production part and minimization of total Earliness/Tardiness of PM activities for maintenance part. Moreover, to cope with the concept of game types we proposed two player behaviors: non-rational and rational behavior. In this research, the Nash equilibrium in game theory based approach is used to deal with the multiple objectives. Computational experiment on both standard PFSP problems and non- standard PM instances shows the effectiveness of the proposed solving algorithms.",

For this purpose, our approach is based on P2P computing that proved to be scalable, efficient and robust solutions for distributed discovery of SWs. Indeed, we propose a matching technique of ontology OWL-S process model, in order to efficiently and effectively discover appropriate Web services distributed among all peers in a large-size P2P network. For improving performance and effectiveness, our scalable approach is mapped on unstructured P2P networks by exploiting Pareto efficiency to reduce considerably the execution time and message exchanged for …",

        "Description": "Palmprint is one of the modalities that offer high recognition accuracy. The recognition process depends on an optimized ROI (Region of Interest) extraction. This extraction is affected by several factors including the device used and the acquisition conditions. The acquisition step can alter some image properties like rotation, translation and scale. Some devices are designed to maintain hand in a fixed position and delimit a subspace of the hand. On the other hand, contactless devices offer more convenience and flexibility but lead to altered images. ROI extraction methods must consider the acquisition device (with contact or contactless). In this paper, we propose palmprint recognition system considering this issue. A ROI extraction method is implemented and tested on different databases taking into account the acquisition device with different sensor conditions. Our research to test this method, are conducted on …",

In this paper, we will focus on one of these approaches namely block matching. We propose to speed the performances of the block matching algorithm using the Bees' Algorithm which is known for its efficient exploration of search space as it uses two interesting strategies intensification and diversification. The proposed algorithm, BAforBM, is evaluated and compared to two existing ones: genetic bloc matching algorithm and a block matching algorithm based on PSO (Particule Swarm Optimisation).",

These systems also provide clearing functions to reduce interbank payments but are sometimes exposed to liquidity risks. Monitoring, and optimizing the interbank exchanges through suitable tools is useful for the proper functioning of these systems. The goal is to add to these systems an intelligent software layer integrated with the existing system for the improvement of transactions processing and consequently avoid deadlock situations, deficiencies and improve system efficiency. We model and develop by multi-agent an intelligent tracking system of the interbank exchanged transactions to optimize payments settlement and minimize liquidity risks.",

Despite extensive research in this area, existing approaches either require repetitive computations or fail to capture key community behavioral events, both of which limit the ability to generate timely and actionable insights. Efficiently tracking community structures is crucial for real-time decision-making in rapidly evolving networks, while capturing behavioral events is necessary for understanding deeper community dynamics. This study addresses these limitations by proposing a more efficient and adaptive solution. It aims to answer the following questions: How can we efficiently track community structures without recomputation? How can we detect significant community events over time …",

        "Description": "Fingerprint-based biometric systems are widely used because of their advantages against conventional authentication systems based on passwords and tokens. However, a major limitation is that individuals’ fingerprint information cannot be easily changed if compromised. The fuzzy vault is a promising technique that secures fingerprint data by generating a set of data from the fingerprint using an injective function, preventing the original fingerprint from being regenerated. Nevertheless, the fingerprint fuzzy vault is computationally intensive and requires substantial memory resources. We propose enhancing the performance of fingerprint fuzzy vaults and reducing resource consumption using a new chaff point generation technique based on square boundaries and composite representation. We conducted integration testing along with detailed benchmarking of the fingerprint fuzzy vault using square-boundary …",

        "Description": "Providing high-quality predictions is no longer the sole goal for neural networks. As we live in an increasingly interconnected world, these models need to match the constraints of resource-limited devices powering the Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded systems. Moreover, in the era of climate change, reducing the carbon footprint of neural networks is a critical step for green artificial intelligence, which is no longer an aspiration but a major need. Enhancing the energy efficiency of neural networks, in both training and inference phases, became a predominant research topic in the field. Training optimization has grown in interest recently but remains challenging, as it involves changes in the learning procedure that can impact the prediction quality significantly. This article presents a study on the most popular techniques aiming to reduce the energy consumption of neural networks’ training. We first propose a …",

Machines, while operational, consume varying amounts of energy based on their state: idle states consume less energy than active ones. Additionally, energy consumption is influenced by both the production job and the specific machine.Our goal is to minimize two functions: the first pertains to reducing production and maintenance earliness/tardiness, while the second focuses on minimizing energy consumption. To address this problem, a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) is proposed. The ϵ—constrained method is employed for computing the Pareto front, and further adaptation involves applying the Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing algorithm (MOSA) to handle instances of substantial size …",

        "Description": "Due to the sophistication of recent malware, classical detection approaches are becoming obsolete. Machine Learning for malware detection has emerged as a new trend and is becoming increasingly effective. Indeed, malware generate a tremendous amount of data that should be analyzed and used to detect them. The aim of this paper is to propose a Machine Learning approach to detect both recent and old malware by converting them into images. This approach, which consists of two phases, is based on Transfer Learning through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that extract features from malware images. These features are used to determine the maliciousness of a particular file. We define six strategies, each one is a combination of two image types (Grayscale and Color) and three CNN architectures (VGG, ResNet and Inception). Experimental evaluation has been done to test these six strategies. The strategy that fulfills the most testing goals is Grayscale+ ResNet with a testing accuracy of 90.08%. Even if the first results are promising, the future work is to automate the fine-tuning of the parameters to go through all possible values and obtain the best ones.",

        "Description": "Hyper-heuristics can be applied to solve complex optimization problems. Recently, an efficient hyper-heuristic (HHGA) was proposed for solving the permutation flowshop problem (PFSP), one of the most important scheduling type in modern industries. HHGA is a hyper genetic algorithm (GA) that evolves GAs to solve the PFSP. It designs, automatically, efficient GA per instance. However, HHGA evolves in a huge search space (more than 9 million GAs). Moreover, at each generation, HHGA needs to execute many GAs, which requires a very large number of fitness evaluations; thus, inducing huge computational overhead. To overcome this problem, this paper aims at integrating machine learning techniques into HHGA. The objective is to approximate, in an offline approach, the fitness function, reducing considerably the execution time of HHGA while maintaining its quality.

It is an NP-hard problem for which Genetic algorithms have been widely used. This is due to the obtained competitive results. However, their main drawback is the fitness computation which is time-consuming, especially when working with huge data. To overcome this problem, we propose an offline approach in which we substitute the GA’s fitness computation with a Machine Learning model. The latter will predict the quality of the different generated solutions during the search process. The performed tests on several well-known datasets of different sizes show the effectiveness of our approach.",

        "Description": "With its various real-life applications, predicting community evolution is a challenging task in the field of social network analysis. In this paper, we analyze communities’ evolution prediction accuracy in dynamic social networks. The proposed approach combines two key concepts of the process, aiming to enrich the prediction model by additional information that could improve the results:(1) a tailored network splitting that results in snapshots of different periods rather than a static one, and (2) the change rates of communities’ features that characterize them over time instead of absolute values of features. Our experiments on four realworld social networks confirm that community evolution prediction can be achieved with a very high accuracy by using both tailored network splitting as a first step of prediction process and change rates of features.",

Several methods were proposed in the literature to optimize this step for resource constrained environments. The challenge is to generate the desired number of chaff-points in a minimum and homogeneous time and a minimum amount of computational re-sources. In this paper, we propose a new chaff-points generation method based on genetic algorithm and non-fixed squares boundaries for resource constrained devices. The obtained results showed that our method gives the desired number of chaff-points in a better time than other methods.",

So, efficiency and effectiveness has become a stern challenge for distributed discovery to tackle uniformed behavior evolution of service and maintain high efficiency for large-scale computing. The distributed discovery of SWs according to their functionality increases the capability of an application to fulfill their own goals. In this paper, we describe an efficient and an effective approach for improving the performance and effectiveness of distributed discovery of SWs in P2P systems. As most Web services lack a rich semantic description, we extend the distributed discovery process by exploiting collaborative ranking to estimate the similarity of a SWs being used by existing hybrid matching technique of …",

To effectively manage these risks, we should understand the complexity of the market due to its evolution in an uncertain environment. This is possible through multi-agent modeling and simulation while taking into consideration risk indicators. We, propose, in this paper, to model a financial market simulation system using a multi-agent model, where agents represent the different market participants. The reasoning model of our agents is based on different risk indicators. We use the classifier systems as reasoning and learning model for the cognitive agents of our system. This system is a decision tool dedicated to managers or experts wanting to analyze and understand through the behaviour of the different participants, the evolution of the global dynamics of the market and the influence of the different risk factors on the market and on the various categories of market participants.",

        "Description": "Les accélérateurs matériels ont été depuis longtemps utilisés pour booster les performances dans les MPSoC. Cependant, ces derniers introduisent un surplus d’occupation de surface sur ces systèmes. Le travail présenté dans cet article présente un outil pour trouver un compromis entre l’accélération apportée par ces accélérateurs matériels et la surface occupée par ces derniers. Pour ce faire, nous proposons d’utiliser un nouveau type d’architectures basé sur le partage d’accélérateurs matériels. Nous présentons une approche d’exploration de l’espace de conception (ou DSE pour Design Space Exploration) basée sur un algorithme génétique hybridé à un nouveau type de recherche locale (PVNS), pour l’exploration bi-objectif de l’espace de conception, dans les architectures à base de partage d’accélérateurs matériels. L’approche proposée a été testée sur trois applications: le Multiple Target Tracking (MTT), le JPEG et une application synthétique. Notre algorithme apporte un gain en temps d’exploration pouvant atteindre les 99.86% par rapport aux travaux existants basés sur un modèle mixte de programmation linéaire en nombres entiers (MILP), tout en y ajoutant la considération de la contrainte d’accélération. Cette approche permet une réduction de la surface occupée par les accélérateurs pouvant atteindre les 81, 48%, par rapport à une implémentation sans partage d’accélérateurs.",

With the evolution of Semantic Web services (SWs) within organizations and their uses in a large-scale, composition of services in a distributed setting has become a real challenge. A mechanism for automatic composition of SWs according to their functionality is necessary, since the features are the most important thing that partners seek. In this paper, we describe a distributed approach to automatic composition of SWs, which supports the complexity of both SWs and the task at hand. The approach is based on the notion of alignment of OWL-S, in order to achieve semantic interoperability in a heterogeneous and distributed architecture, to ensure correct operation of Web services provided, and meet the needs and users’ preferences. The objective is to optimize the time of the completion of the automatic composition of SWs, and to overcome the problem of communication within and between SWs and network saturation.",

        "Description": "B&B algorithms are well known techniques for exact solving of combinatorial optimization problems (COP). They perform an implicit enumeration of the search space instead of exhaustive one. Based on a pruning technique, they reduce considerably the computation time required to explore the whole search space. Nevertheless, these algorithms remain inefficient when dealing with large combinatorial optimization instances. They are time-intensive and they require a huge computing power to be solved optimally. Nowadays, multi-core-based processors and GPU accelerators are often coupled together to achieve impressive performances. However, classical B&B algorithms must be rethought to deal with their two divergent architectures. In this paper, we propose a new B&B approach exploiting both the multi-core aspect of actual processors and GPU accelerators. The proposed approaches have been executed to solve FSP instances that are well-known combinatorial optimization benchmarks. Real experiments have been carried out on an Intel Xeon 64-bit quad-core processor E5520 coupled to an Nvidia Tesla C2075 GPU device. The results show that our hybrid B&B approach speeds up the execution time up to x123 over the sequential mono-core B&B algorithm.",

        "Description": "This work consists in simulating a real time interbank gross payment system (RTGS) through a multi-agent model, to analyze the evolution of the liquidity brought by the banks to the system. In this model, each bank chooses the amount of a daily liquidity provided in the system on the basis of costs minimization (costs of liquidity and delaying) by taking into account the liquidity brought by the other banks. Banks agents reasoning is based on a repeated aggregate game of over several payment days where each bank plays against the other banks. For adaptive behaviour we integrate into bank agents a learning classifier system. We carry out then several simulations to follow the system total liquidity evolution as that of each bank agent with varying costs coefficients. The question to be answered is: what are the cash amounts that banks must provide and under what constraints (costs of liquidity and delaying) the system beyond the lack of liquidity (illiquidity)? We find that liquidity e volution depends on costs coefficients.",

They are often subject to significant fluctuations due to unanticipated behaviours and information. Modelling and simulating these systems by means of agent systems, ie, through artificial markets is a valuable approach. In this article, we present our model of asynchronous artificial market consisting of a set of adaptive and heterogeneous agents in interaction. These agents represent the various market participants (investors and institutions). Investor Agents have advanced mental models for ordinary investors which do not relay on fundamental or technical analysis methods. On one hand, these models are based on the risk tolerance and on the other hand on the information gathered by the agents. This information results from overhearing influential investors in the market or the order books. We model the system through investor agents using learning classifier systems as reasoning models. As a result, our artificial market allows the study of overhearing impacts on the market. We also present the experimental evaluation results of our model.",

        "Description": "Open complex systems as financial markets evolve in a highly dynamic and uncertain environment. They are often subject to significant fluctuations due to unanticipated behaviours and information. Modelling and simulating these systems by means of agent systems, i.e., through artificial markets is a valuable approach. In this article, we present our model of asynchronous artificial market consisting of a set of adaptive and heterogeneous agents in interaction. These agents represent the various market participants (investors and institutions). Investor Agents have advanced mental models for ordinary investors which do not relay on fundamental or technical analysis methods. On one hand, these models are based on the risk tolerance and on the other hand on the information gathered by the agents. This information results from overhearing influential investors in the market or the order books. We model the system through investor agents using learning classifier systems as reasoning models. As a result, our artificial market allows the study of overhearing impacts on the market. We also present the experimental evaluation results of our model.",

        "Description": "Tiramisu is a polyhedral compiler for generating fast code. It provides high level scheduling commands to optimize programs. Selecting what scheduling commands to apply to a piece of code, the parameters of those commands, and the ordering between them is a challenging task. It requires substantial time, effort, and expertise to construct beneficial combinations of optimizations that improve the run-time of the program. Our work is an attempt to automate code optimization within the Tiramisu framework, by leveraging the advances in deep learning techniques. More concretely, we aim to use a neural-network-based cost model to evaluate schedules, which would allow fast and efficient search space exploration to find well-performing schedules for an input program. We developed a code generation module for Tiramisu and used it to construct a starting dataset to train our neural network.",

        "Description": "Nowadays, there is an increasing trend in the use of solar energy by using photovoltaic system (PVS). The power generated by a PVS highly relies on solar intensity. Therefore, a Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) is one of the key components of solar electricity generation. It is used to extract the maximum power point (MPP) produced by a PVS. In this paper, we present an intelligent Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to track the MPP thereby increasing the performance of the PVS. The proposed ACO algorithm is developed in Matlab/Simulink environment. Furthermore, the results obtained from the ACO algorithm are compared with the well-known conventional Perturb and Observe (P&O) algorithm.",

Supported by author publication charges (APC), its hallmarks are a rapid peer review and publication process with open access to all readers. Unlike IEEE's traditional Transactions or Journals, reviews are \"binary\", in that reviewers will either Accept or Reject an article in the form it is submitted in order to achieve rapid turnaround. Especially encouraged are submissions on:\n\nMultidisciplinary topics, or applications-oriented articles and negative results that do not fit within the scope of IEEE's traditional journals.\nPractical articles discussing new experiments or measurement techniques, interesting solutions to engineering.\nDevelopment of new or improved fabrication or manufacturing techniques.\nReviews or survey articles of new or evolving fields oriented to assist others in understanding the new area.",

The proposed approaches aim to show that the efficiency of GAs in solving flowshop problems can be improved significantly by tailoring the various AIS operators to suit the problem structure. The proposed hybridization scheme is applied in two ways: (1) the first hybrid of GA and AIS introduces vaccination (Jiao and Wang, IEEE Trans Syst Man Sybernetics Part A Syst Hum 30(5):552–561, 2000) into the field of GAs based on the theory of immunity in biology, (2) the second takes its inspiration on the immune network theory (Perelson, Immunol Rev 110(1):5–36, 1989), and applied it to the field of GAs. The proposed hybrid metaheuristics produce high quality solutions as proved by the tests performed over Taillard’s (Eur J Oper Res 64(2):278 …",

We implemented two strategies of ACS for the GCP; construction strategy and improvement strategy. In construction strategy, the algorithm iteratively constructs feasible solutions. The phase of construction is carried out by a specific constructive method for the problem, that is: recursive largest first (RLF) or DSATUR. These two constructive methods take into account different updates of pheromone trails and the heuristic information. The improvement strategy uses a local search, namely tabu search, to improve the best solution obtained at each iteration of the algorithm. To test the efficiency of our approach, we also implement best-known algorithms for the GCP. That is, scatter search (SS) which, integrates also tabu search (TS), ant system (AS), RLF and DSATUR.

Contrary to most of swarm intelligence algorithms such as ant colony optimisation (ACO), MBO uses self-organisation to mix different heuristics. In this paper, we present an MBO approach for the graph colouring problem (GCP). We propose, as worker, in our algorithm (BeesCol) one of the following methods: local search, taboo search or a proposed-based ant colony system algorithm (IACSCol). The worker intervenes at two levels; it improves initial and crossed solutions. Moreover, in BeesCol, one or several queens are generated randomly or by a specific constructive method, namely, recursive largest first or DSATUR. Experimental results on some well studied Dimacs graphs are reported. A comparison between BeesCol and some best-known algorithms for the GCP (hybrid colouring …",

Given a graph G and sets T of positive integers associated to the edges of G, a T-colouring of G is an assignment of colours to its vertices so the assigned colours distances do not exist in the associated set T. Since this problem is NP-Complete, only few heuristics are implemented for restricted conditions on the sets T. The ant colony optimisation (ACO) has been successfully applied to different problems [SAL08]. Nevertheless, no attempt of ACO has been published for the T-colouring problem. We introduce, in this paper, two hybrid evolutionary approaches combining an ACO algorithm and a tabu search for the GTCP. These approaches are experimented for the general and restricted cases of the GTCP with different parameter's settings. The results are encouraging and show often better results than …",

The game is coupled with genetic algorithm to accelerate convergence and produce Nash equilibrium and Pareto non-dominated solutions simultaneously. The proposed hybrid approach produces high quality solutions as proved by several performed tests and corroborated by the comparison with the most referred multi-objective optimization algorithms such as NSGA-II and SPEA2 on well-known Philadelphia and COST259 FAP instances. Furthermore, the effect of some parameters is discussed.",

In this paper, we propose a metaheuristic inspired from the steps of human brainstorming process for creative problems solving, to the challenge of solving the community detection problem in social networks. The proposed method seeks to maximize the network modularity in order to identify the best partition and the most approximate to the real community structure.

The artificial immune system (AIS) has been proposed for solving several combinatorial optimisation problems. This paper presents a hybrid approach based on AIS combined to a local search for solving the CGLMP. To validate the implemented approach, many tests were carried out on academic benchmarks, and, an empirical adjustment of its parameters has been achieved. To improve the performance of this algorithm, a parallel implementation has been realised.",

Two types of cooperative games are suggested depending on the TRX and frequency selection strategies each using two players, one for each considered objective. A feasible solution consisting of a frequency assignment plan is built during the constructive process. At each step of the game, a player assigns a frequency to a TRX according to a given strategy. The proposed solution being part of both multi-objective optimization (MOO) and game theory (GT), we used the most important measures in these two fields: the hypervolume (HV) and the Nash value, to evaluate the performance of our solutions to able to compare our results with those …",

We propose to use an evolutionary metaheuristic, biogeography-based multi-objective optimisation algorithm (BBMO), to solve the considered problem. As it is a bi-objective approach, our results are represented by a set of non-dominated solutions based on the definition of Pareto optimum front.

It consists on coloring the vertices of a graph in such a way that the two colors assigned to two adjacent vertices i and j does not appear in Tij, where Tij is a set of positive integers associated to the edge [i,j]. The T-Coloring problem is to find the minimum length of the spectrum of colors used. Honey-bees are among the most closely studied social insects. Honey bee mating may also be considered as a typical swarm-based approach to optimization, in which the search algorithm (Marriage Bees Optimization: MBO) is inspired by the process of marriage in real bees' colonies. In this paper, an MBO algorithm is presented for three coloring problems: graph coloring, Restricted T-colorings and general T-colorings. Several experiments are performed in order to …",

Moreover, the algorithm is supplemented with a clonal selection, inherited from Artificial Immune Systems (AIS), which aims to improve the algorithm exploration and exploitation abilities. Computational experiments performed over COST259 instances show the efficiency of the newly proposed evolutionary multi-objective algorithm and corroborated by the comparisons we did with the most frequently referred algorithm in the …",

We first present two ACS new strategies (ACS1 and ASC2) and an MBO approach (BeesCol) for the GCP, then, we offer several collaboration modes and parallelisation for the proposed methods using a parallel machine simulated on a cluster of PCs. An empirical study is undertaken for each method. Moreover, to test our approach, we have also implemented effective algorithms for the GCP.

The problem is formulated as a new sequential cooperative game that optimizes simultaneously two objectives (interference cost and separation cost) while fulfilling co-channel and adjacent channel constraints, thus avoiding or minimizing interferences. The proposed game, incrementally, builds a feasible solution, according to players' strategies. At each step, a transceiver (TRX) is chosen from a set of untreated TRXs which we have not yet assigned a frequency. Then, each player chooses a frequency from its set of available frequencies, according to a given strategy, and assigns it to that TRX. Moreover, a novel assessment method based on the hypervolume (HV) metric and Nash value is described. The provided frequencies assignment plans achieve a good compromise …",

        "Description": "This paper introduces a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to address the challenges associated with configuring and optimizing genetic algorithms (GAs) for solving difficult combinatorial or non-linear problems. The proposed RL+GA method was specifically tested on the flow shop scheduling problem (FSP). The hybrid algorithm incorporates neural networks (NN) and uses the off-policy method Q-learning or the on-policy method Sarsa(0) to control two key genetic algorithm (GA) operators: parent selection mechanism and mutation. At each generation, the RL agent's action is determining the selection method, the probability of the parent selection and the probability of the offspring mutation. This allows the RL agent to dynamically adjust the selection and mutation based on its learned policy. The results of the study highlight the effectiveness of the RL+GA approach in improving the performance of the primitive GA. They also demonstrate its ability to learn and adapt from population diversity and solution improvements over time. This adaptability leads to improved scheduling solutions compared to static parameter configurations while maintaining population diversity throughout the evolutionary process.",

        "Description": "In the domain of social network analysis, the frequent pattern mining task gives large opportunities for knowledge discovery. One of the most recent variations of the pattern definition applied to social networks is the frequent conceptual links (FCL). A conceptual link represents a set of links connecting groups of nodes such as nodes of each group share common attributes. When the number of these links exceeds a predefined threshold, it is referred to as a frequent conceptual link and it aims to describe the network in term of the most connected type of nodes while exploiting structural and semantic information of the network. Since the inception of this technique, a number of improvements were achieved in the search process in order to optimise its performances. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for extracting frequent conceptual links from large networks. By adopting a new compressed structure for the network, the proposed approach reaches up to 90% of gain in the execution time.",

Given a graph G and a set T of positive integers associated to each edge of G, a T-Coloring of G is to assign one color to each vertex of G so the distance between the assigned colors does not exist in the associated set T. Since this problem is NP-Complete, heuristic methods must be involved. Only few methods are implemented for a restricted case, in which the sets T are composed from consecutive integers.",

However, accurately identifying communities is challenging due to the complex nature of social networks. To address this challenge, we propose CD-BSO, an innovative metaheuristic based on brainstorming. CD-BSO leverages network knowledge through specialized initialization and solution generation operators designed to capture social network characteristics. In the initialization phase, a technique combining Depth-First Search (DFS) is employed to consider both connectivity and information diffusion, ensuring accurate community representation. The generation step introduces search operators that consider link formation and node similarity, facilitating convergence towards a community structure that closely resembles the network's actual structure. The evaluation of CD-BSO outperforms recent and well …",

MCTS-CD is an arm-bandit [2] anytime algorithm.

Community detection problem consists of finding a strategy for detecting cohesive groups, based on shared interests, choices, and preferences, given a social network where nodes represent users and edges represent interactions between them. In this work, we propose a hybrid method for the community detection problem that encompasses both traditional tree search algorithms and deep learning techniques. We begin by introducing a beam-search algorithm with a modularity-based agglomeration function as a foundation. To enhance its performance, we further hybridize this approach by incorporating DeepWalk embeddings into the process and leveraging a novel similarity metric for community structure assessment. Experimentation on both synthetic and real-world networks demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, particularly excelling in small to medium-sized networks, outperforming widely adopted methods.",

In this paper we present L-SAGA, a generative hyper-heuristic designed for finding optimal to sub-optimal solutions for the PFSP. L-SAGA combines a high level simulated annealing with a learning component and a low level PFSP adapted genetic algorithm.

        "Description": "Community detection is a landmark problem in social network analysis. To address this challenge, we propose SPACED: Spaced Positional Autoencoder for Community Embedding Detection, a deep learning-based approach designed to effectively tackle the complexities of community detection in social networks. SPACED generates neighborhood-aware embeddings of network nodes using an autoencoder architecture. These embeddings are then refined through a mixed learning strategy with generated community centers, making them more community-aware. This approach helps unravel network communities through an appropriate clustering strategy. Experimental evaluations across synthetic and real-world networks, as well as comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, demonstrate the high competitiveness and often superiority of SPACED for community detection while maintaining reasonable time complexities.",

This problem can be modeled as an NP-hard optimization problem. Inspired from [24][23] that combined Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Reinforcement Learning on large action-space environments, we adapt MCTS for the problem of Community Detection in Social Networks and propose MCTS-CD. MCTSCD is an arm-bandit [2] anytime algorithm. We show that when compared to reference algorithms for CD such as Louvain [1], with allocating the same amount of resources, MCTS-CD acheives better results on many benchmark datasets such as Zachary Karate Club, Dolphin and the Pol Books datasets.",

In this work, a hybridization of Q-Learning algorithm and Game theory is proposed to deal with the multi-objective Frequency Assignment Problem (FAP) in cellular networks considering two competing objectives namely interference and separation costs. The game embeds two learning players (agents), one for each objective. It occurs in a number of episodes in which a set of actions are considered to generate a frequency assignment plan providing a good trade-o between the two considered con icting objectives. The results of the experiments over two real-world cellular networks of two US cities, using Hypervolume and Nash metrics demonstrated the e ectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "Description": "New mobile applications, with growing computing requirements on the one hand, and limited battery capacity on the other, need intelligent and efficient solutions to extend battery life while reducing latency. To tackle this problem, a new emerging paradigm known as Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) has been introduced, ensuring optimal use of network resources while minimizing latency. The computational offloading problem is part of this context. It allows the transfer of the computation of traffic and services from a centralized cloud to the edge of the network and then closer to the client. We deal in this work, with the offloading problem considering a multi-user model system in an unbalanced MEC architecture, achieving a trade-off between energy consumption, latency and the cost to access the edge cloud server. Since the NP-hadness of this problem, the exact methods are not suitbale, mainly for big instances. To solve this challenging issue, we propose an efficient hybrid genetic algorithm based on a genetic algorithm and a VNS variable neighborhood search taking into account the problem specificity. In order to deduce the best combination that provides the solution with the lowest cost, several possible hybridization schemes are proposed: a sequential hybridization, and two memetic algorithms where the local search is integrated into the genetic evolutionary process to overcome the shortcomings of the genetic algorithm, improving the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the algorithm. Both genetic operators (mutation and crossover) and VNS are adapted to our problem, making them more effective in finding the offloading …",

Indeed, mobile apps become more and more complex and evolve constantly, while their development time decreases. This complexity and time pressure might lead developers to adopt bad design and implementation choices, which are known as code smells. Code smells in mobile apps could lead to performance issues such as overconsumption of hardware resources (CPU, RAM, battery) or even downtime and crashes. Some tools have been proposed for the detection of code smells in Android apps, such as PAPRIKA or ADOCTOR tools. These tools rely on metrics-based detection rules, which are defined manually according to code smell definitions.

        "Description": "Several education hypermedia systems (EHS) use learning styles (LS) as a criterion for adaptation and tracking. To measure these styles, EHS are generally based on the questionnaires provided by the used LS model, and that learners should answer before the first session. This approach has a major drawback: learners’ LS are defined only once. To overcome this limitation, recent researches are currently being done on the detection of LS based on learner’s interaction traces. Their general criticism is related to the use of a specific environment, and therefore specific traces and indicators. Therefore, we aim to identify the learner’s LS automatically, based on simple navigation traces. In this paper, we present experimental results of identification of sequential/global and active/reflective LS, for 45 students, using supervised classification. The findings provide initial evidence that LS can be automatically identified …",

The main goal of this research is to help teachers to perceive and interpret the learner's activities in elearning situations, by exploiting and analyzing the tracks and providing knowledge on the activities, that we call learning indicators. In this paper, we present our initial proposal to automatically determine the learners' learning style in web based learning from learning indicators. The advantage of this approach is that it allows having a dynamically updated value of the learning style provided by the interpretation of tracks on the learner's activities. Furthermore, we propose the modeling of the learning style as a classification of the styles models proposed in the literature that can be detected in such a context. Thus the approach is independent of a particular learning style model. It is implemented in IDLS, a track based …",

        "Description": "Learning systems are dedicated for learning about a particular area organized through non-linear documents. Therefore, it is always useful to recognize the state of knowledge and the navigation behaviour of a learner in order to evaluate customize and adapt the learning process. In this paper, we aim to make a semantic analysis of the learner’s navigation during his apprenticeship in hypermedia content. The main reason of this analysis is to identify the browsing behaviour of a learner with the current course. We assume that if the semantic distance between the domain concepts of the documents (or pages) that follow each other in the navigation of a learner is great, then this reflects the unstructured navigation behaviour and interprets that the learner is disoriented. This type of behaviour could be due to the poor organization of the content and the bad structuring of the course. Indeed, this analysis will allow to the tutor, to identify the disoriented learners and help them, and to the course author, to specify the causes to restructure and to deepen the analysis of the existing content and the navigation links between the parts of the course.",

This task may mean, in a FOAD process, to carry out the real part of a project manager, with project specifications, with regards to technical and economic parameters.  This gives way to so many functions, not common ones at all, for the traditional act of teaching.  In fact, a teacher is not supposed to be a technology expert that is to create simulations, control a programming language, etc. To palliate this problem, the development of contents must be made easy by the use of a creation tool.  We present, in this paper, an authoring system called TAALIM, which aim to facilitate the tasks allotted to the designer through a simple elaboration process model, as well as a generic model of interactive multi-media teaching contents.

The analysis of these log files, or traces, provides \"knowledge\" about the activity we call indicators. Our work is related to this research field. We are particularly interested in automatically identifying learners’ learning styles from learning indicators. This concept, used in several Educational Hypermedia Systems (EHS) as a criterion for adaptation and tracking, belongs to a set of behaviors and strategies in how to manage and organize information. In this paper, we validate our approach of auto-detection of student's learning styles based on their navigation behavior using machine-learning classifiers.",

A demand that forces developers to rush the implementation process and shorten the conception phase, leading to poor conception and implementation choices known as code smells. These smells have a negative effect on both device and application's performance, and must therefore be corrected to ensure the quality of mobile applications and the smoothness of their users' experience. This task requires the identification of the infected entities and their refactoring. Most existing refactoring approaches and techniques are focused on object-oriented applications' code smells while only a few of them are destined to Android specific code smells.In this paper, we present a tool, named RAndroid, that handles automatic refactoring for four different Android specific code smells, and gives …",

This adaptation approach benefits from the found correlation between this indicator and learning styles, particularly Sequential/Global and Active/Reflective styles. Many studies use leaning styles for adaptation based on educational rules. Thus, we propose for each value of the navigation type indicator, to provide the learner with the appropriate adaptation to the learning style correlated with the indicator value.",

The identification of rumors on social networks is one of the most recent and important issues, because of its impacts and the difficulty of manual processing.In this work, we propose a rumor detection approach in the Algerian arabizi. It extracts information with the associations between rumors and reactions of social network users. The features extracted from the associations and other features representing the semantics of the users’ expression, are feed to an attention mechanism to compute their importance used in the construction of deep learning models.

Dans le cas de documents hypermédias, il est toujours utile de reconnaitre le comportement de navigation de l’apprenant avant de pouvoir évaluer, personnaliser et adapter le processus d’apprentissage. Dans ce papier, nous visons l’analyse sémantique de la navigation de l’apprenant durant son apprentissage dans des contenus hypermédias. La raison principale de cette analyse est d’identifier le comportement de navigation d’un apprenant avec le cours étudié. Nous partons de l’hypothèse que si la distance sémantique entre les concepts du domaine des documents (ou pages) qui se suivent dans la navigation d’un apprenant est grande, alors ceci traduit un comportement déstructuré dans la navigation de l’apprenant et interprète une désorientation de ce dernier. Ce type de comportement pourrait être dû soit au faible niveau de connaissances de l’apprenant et/ou à une mauvaise organisation et structuration du cours. En effet, cette analyse va permettre au tuteur de reconnaitre les apprenants désorientés et les aider, et à l’auteur du cours de restructurer et d’approfondir l’analyse des liens de navigation existants entre les parties du cours.",

        "Description": "This article aims to present ESITrace, an e-learning-dedicated trace collector. ESITrace collects different kinds of traces produced by the learner while doing his learning activities, in the context of a Web based learning environment. This tool is a keylogger that collects two kinds of traces: involuntary ones, called simply “traces” and annotations which are added by the learner on his learning material to memorize his ideas. We follow a learner-side approach to track the entire learner’s activities, even those made outside the e-learning system. These traces enable the teacher to be aware about the learner’s activities and progression, and can be used by the learning management system to adapt the learning material to the learner behavior.",

The analysis of the semantic path of a learner or group of learners during the learning process can allow detecting those students who are in needs of help as well as identify the insufficiently mastered concepts. We examine the possibility of using a student’s browsing path during a learning session, based on his navigation traces, to update the learner model. We assume that the domain concepts examined outside the learning platform but that are related to the course concepts are problematic to the learner. Knowing about these concepts may allow the course’s author to adapt the course to the learner’s needs regarding these concepts, as well as allow the tutor to help and assist the learner on these problematic concepts. We rely on Web data mining methods to filter, organize, and analyze the …",

This radical change has influenced the students’ behavior, emotional state as well as their ability to learn. In order to analyze this situation, we focus in this work on the automatic detection of students’ emotions while exploiting the techniques and methods of sentiment analysis and machine learning. The proposed solution aims to predict students’ emotions and some of the aspects related to online learning from students’ reviews and then infers the attitude of students using association rules and clustering. The data-set consists of students’ answers in a forum sent at the end of sessions and semesters, annotated manually, during online learning. The obtained results using precision and recall was satisfying and favorable.",

In this article, SDLD (Structure Dialogue Learning Design) is presented, which is a semiformal EML that aims to improve controllability of learning design quality, one of the major concerns of practitioners that has not been previously addressed by EMLs. To address this problem, SDLD follows the proposals of Transactional Distance Theory (TDT). The adoption of this theory helps to measure, identify, and integrate the determinants of learning design quality in the creation of learning designs. Results from using SDLD showed that it improves the expressiveness of EMLs, especially in terms of the interactional facet of learning units and confirmed that it improves the usefulness of existing EMLs. In this context, SDLD represents …",

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) has emerged as a widely adopted open-standard modeling approach. This paper introduces a Y-Design Formal Modeling Framework tailored for the efficient design and development of RESTful web service-based e-learning systems. Rooted in the 2-Track Unified Process (2TUP), the Y-Design framework structures the design process into three stages, each strategically employing selected UML diagrams: a functional stage focusing on capturing and modeling user requirements, a technical stage addressing architectural needs and defining system components, and a design-integration stage that harmonizes both tracks into a unified system. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework are validated through the implementation of a typical e-learning system, demonstrating its potential to streamline design while ensuring robust and scalable solutions for modern distributed systems. The proposed framework emphasizes agility and coherence, making it particularly suited for e-learning projects requiring modularity and efficient reuse of common e-learning users' required services.",

        "Description": "We present in this paper a modeling approach of the pedagogical sequencing of learning units which is called a PGM Pedagogical Graph Model. This graph allows expressing the totality of the pedagogical constraints. PGM is a graph in which the nodes are the learning units and the arcs are the pedagogical constraints between learning units. This will help the author to well structure his/her course and pedagogical relations between the various pedagogical units that compose it and help the learner to be oriented during the browsing in the course avoiding thus the disadvantages of the hypertext links.",

        "Description": "The development of e-learning platforms often focuses on designing system requirements, rather than users’ functional requirements, which negatively impacts user behavior, interaction, and overall e-learning experience. This research addresses that gap by proposing a user-centric web services architecture for e-learning systems. Our approach designs RESTful web services APIs to specific required and desired functionalities of various e-learning users including learners, tutors, teachers, and administrators. The effectiveness of this design approach is demonstrated through a comprehensive overview of the implementation process of an e-learning prototype built using the Django REST framework. The e-learning system's user experience was rigorously evaluated through well-known User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ). Evaluation results revealed high performance across all user experience dimensions, surpassing standard benchmarks, particularly in efficiency and attractiveness scales. This research demonstrates that the system’s user-centric design based on user-oriented web service can streamline the development processes of e-learning platforms while enhancing the system's attractiveness and the overall user experience.",

        "Description": "Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) is a rapidly expanding communication system for Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) in the Internet of Things (IoTs) deployments. It employs an Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) scheme that optimizes data rate, airtime, and energy consumption. Recently, the use of Network Slicing (NS) in LoRa Wannetworks is being widely studied and a hot topic for the latest research in the literature. Network resources must be efficiently assigned to IoT devices in an isolated manner in order to handle and support specific Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for each slice. However, in dense LoRaWAN networks, the ADR scheme is insufficient for efficient resource allocation to meet the QoS requirements of each slice. In this article, we propose a DRL-based approach for intra-slicing resource allocation in dense LoRa Wannetworks. In each slice, we implemented multi-agent DRL …",

Moreover, due to their unique nature and characteristics, such as their high mobility, VANETs are highly vulnerable to various internal and external attacks. Our aim is to implement security measures, which includes the deployment of misbehavior detection frameworks to effectively mitigate these attacks.

        "Description": "Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) affords communication between vehicles and roadside infrastructures in order to improve road safety and driving conditions. The implementation of precise security mechanisms is imperative in VANET to ensure safety, as attackers are constantly seeking ways to exploit network vulnerabilities. Among the prevalent risks, the masquerade attack stands out as a common and impactful threat. Masquerade is performed by malicious nodes to gain access to the network by impersonating the real identity of a legitimate vehicle. In this paper, we evaluate three variants of masquerade with different machine learning algorithms. These experiments are realised using the F2MD simulation environment with Weka. The performance of the misbehavior detection mechanisms is evaluated by accuracy, recall, and precision. Our comparative results demonstrate that the Random Forest (RF …",

        "Description": "In recent years, various Blind Face Restoration (BFR) techniques were developed. These techniques transform low quality faces suffering from multiple degradations to more realistic and natural face images with high perceptual quality. However, it is crucial for the task of face verification to not only enhance the perceptual quality of the low quality images but also to improve the biometric-utility face quality metrics. Furthermore, preserving the valuable identity information is of great importance. In this paper, we investigate the impact of applying three state-of-the-art blind face restoration techniques namely, GFP-GAN, GPEN and SGPN on the performance of face verification system under very challenging environment characterized by very low quality images. Extensive experimental results on the recently proposed cross-quality LFW database using three state-of-the-art deep face recognition models demonstrate the effectiveness of GFP-GAN in boosting significantly the face verification accuracy.",

NDN relies on caching functionalities and local data storage, such as a content request could be satisfied by any node holding a copy of the content in its storage. Network coding, when combined with NDN, allows a data transfer session to use multiple sources for the content seamlessly to improve content delivery efficiency. In this paper, we address the data pollution issue which is inherent to network coding and we propose a single-path authenticated network coding mechanism for Named Data Networking, where a single route between the source to the destination is established. Packets are encoded, cached and signed among this path. First, we formulate our single-path-based optimal coding and homomorphic signature scheme as a mixed integer program (MIP) problem. We …",

In this context, network slicing emerges as a promising solution for isolating quality of service needs. In addition, URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication) services are essential to enable effective coordination for real-time emergency management and remote equipment control. The integration of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) as flying MECs (Multi-access Edge Computing) to provide the essential resources for network slicing in disaster scenarios has a substantial effect on the scope of emergency operations management. UAVs involvement facilitates extending connectivity to remote areas, where mobile infrastructure is unavailable.

However, the disparity between the computational capabilities of autonomous vehicles and their embedded computations requires offloading computation tasks. To address this issue, RoadSide Units (RSUs) have been introduced, bringing computing units closer to the vehicles. By performing real-time computation tasks at the network edge, RSUs enable faster decision-making and reduce reliance on remote cloud servers. Another solution that enhances the capabilities of smart transportation systems is the collaboration of neighboring vehicles within the framework of vehicular fog computing. However, existing research in task placement for vehicular networks often overlooks the quality of service (QoS) in terms of vehicle-service connectivity, focusing …",

Network coding, when combined with in-network caching, allows to reduce the complexity of cache coordination, to enhance resiliency to errors and to use multipath parallel forwarding to improve the throughput gain. While network coding presents some advantages in a benign environment, its performance may fall in the presence of an adversary which generates the pollution attack.In this work, we evaluate and analyze the security level of an optimized authentication model in NDN.

Now, with the wide diffusion of NoSQL databases holding semi-structured data, there is a growing need for enabling OLAP on document stores as well, to allow non-expert users to get new insights and make better decisions. Unfortunately, due to their schemaless nature, document stores are hardly accessible via direct OLAP querying. In this paper we propose EXODuS, an interactive, schema-on-read approach to enable OLAP querying of document stores in the context of self-service BI and exploratory OLAP. To discover multidimensional hierarchies in document stores we adopt a data-driven approach based on the mining of approximate functional dependencies; to ensure good performances, we incrementally build local portions of hierarchies for the levels involved in …",

It has gained a great interest from both industrials and academics during the last years due to its role in increasing engagement of people in several sectors including business, learning, crowdsourcing and enterprise information systems.

In this context we propose OntoGamif (Ontology of Gamification), a modular ontology for the gamification domain of interest covering topics concerning, for instance, target users, organizational structures, ethical issues, and psychological factors.

Rigorous studies of theoretical, conceptual, or methodological issues pertaining to research application are also welcome.\n\nJournal of Applied Gerontology is also highlighting submissions in three areas that will advance the state-of-the-art in applied gerontological/geriatric research:\n\nstudies that employ mixed methodologies (i.e., the integration of qualitative and quantitative data);\nefforts that translate evidence-based research to clinical practice; and\npolicy evaluations that apply evaluation principles and methods to examine the implementation and effectiveness of a government or institutional policy or program.",

Unfortunately, due to their schemaless nature, document stores are hardly accessible via direct OLAP querying. In this paper we propose an interactive, schema-on-read approach for finding multidimensional structures in document stores aimed at enabling OLAP querying in the context of self-service BI. Our approach works in three steps: multidimensional enrichment, querying, and OLAP enabling; the validation of user queries and the detection of multidimensional structures is based on the mining of approximate functional dependencies from data. The efficiency of our approach is discussed with reference to real datasets.",

In addition, organizations need to make better decisions more quickly. Moreover, they need to change those decisions immediately to adapt to this increasingly dynamic business environment. It is primarily a question in ensuring the decisional aspect by adopting the SOA as a support architecture. In this paper, we describe a new approach called SOA based on a certain number of standards. It is going to be studied on three dimensions: The first is related to the definition of the information system implied in the SOA based on the use case model. The second develops the business dimension which is based on the BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation). The last dimension addresses the need of …",

This work is situated in the general context of stored information heterogeneity in a decisional system such as data, metadata and knowledge, for combination and reconciliation these forms of information by mediation. To add a semantic dimension to the merger, our approach based on semantic enrichment of initial ontologies, this is achieved by enriching initial ontologies by a set of metadata that annotate their concepts with synonyms and homonyms for each concept, via the use of WordNet, or semantic enrichment of an expert, then it generates a thesaurus for each local ontology to build the global thesaurus. Our method focuses on computing semantic similarity between concepts of ontologies, and based on a weighted combination of computing similarity methods, we use syntactic, lexical, structural …",

It gave promising results when applied to many domains. However, analysts predict that most gamification systems are doomed to failure due to the lack of understanding of the gamification design process. Many attempts tried to propose design frameworks for gamification. Nevertheless, only few works were conducted to review the literature in this area of research. The present work is an attempt to review the literature for gamification design. It analyses and compares 28 candidate papers dealing with gamification design for generic application from different digital libraries. It results in a synthesis of the existing body of knowledge and identifies gaps that need to be completed.",

Our proposed approach aims at obtaining a unique multidimensional schema of theXML data warehouse. The approach follows three steps. During the first step, an intermediate SBVR model extended with template rules is used to accommodate a data warehousing system and to facilitate the automatic identification of facts and dimensions from the user requirements. After modelling XML data sources in UML, the second step corresponds to identifying candidate DW schemata from such data sources. The third step compares these candidate schemata with the reference model obtained from the user requirements. In this step, we propose to adapt similarity metric-extended Boolean models (BIR) and to use them in order to measure, rank and select the most appropriate data …",

        "Description": "The importance of the service orientation and its advantages regard to the information system of the company, confront us to a new challenge. It is primarily a question, of ensuring the decisional aspect of the information system of company by adopting the oriented architecture services like a support architecture. This engineering must ensure on the one hand the flexibility of the information system and on the other hand, avoids the redevelopment of system at the request of the decisions. In the actual position, several obstacles force the installation of the SOA within the company. It is basically a question of the lack of architecture to be implemented to define the services architecture within the information system of the company, which takes into account the decisional aspect. Moreover, there's no existing work which treats this challenge. In this paper, we describe an extended Service-Oriented Architecture - SOAda for …",

        "Description": "XML – the Extensible Markup Language has recently emerged as a standard for information representation and exchange on the internet, because of its portability, versatility and extensibility. As the large increase in the availability of such data, there is a need of an appropriate storage and an integration solution for future analysis and decision-making. Data warehouses systems provide a suitable means to organise and manage XML data for decision-making. However, XML data warehouse has some special requirements such as mixed content and irregular structure of XML data sources, which make existing traditional data warehouse approaches and techniques unsuitable. In this paper, we give an overview of current state of the art concerning how XML technologies can be combined with data warehousing systems, by the presentation of the most relevant XML warehousing approaches proposed in the literature.",

That's why enterprises should meticulously choose the suitable technology to improve business management processes. To do so, a clear categorization of the technology according to the enterprise's objective is necessary. The present work is an attempt to classify information technology according to its locus of impact among 12 major technology artifacts. In each IT group previously identified, we precise on which level this technology operates (operational level, decisional level). To build this classification we first clarify the IT definition through a literature review.",

        "Description": "Traditionally, the multidimensional schema of the data warehouse is derived from data sources that are mainly the company’s internal data, well-known and structured, by identifying facts, dimensions and numeric measurements through a manual analysis of the operational schemas. With the proliferation of new platforms of communication in today’s information societies, there has been growing numbers of web-based applications such as online social networks that generate huge amounts of XML data on the web. Therefore, it is increasingly important to develop an appropriate warehousing approach for such ever-growing XML data sources. However, XML documents have a complex hierarchical structure. Moreover, designing and building DWs is tedious, timeconsuming, error-prone and expensive process. In this paper, we describe an approach for automatically generating and building the star schema for data warehouse from XML schema. This approach is extensively based on standards (UML, XML, QVT, and XSLT). First, we model the structure of XML (XML Schema) using the Unified Modeling Language, which is the standard language for object oriented analysis and design. Then, we provide an algorithm that automatically selects the multidimensional concepts. After that, a representation in an XML schema language as the XML data warehouse schema description is derived automatically from UML star schema. Furthermore, we choose Query/Views/Transformation (QVT), which is also OMG standard transformation language for defining and formalizing transformations between models. Finally, a prototype tool is implemented for …",

However, the main research s’ubject of this paper, fusing MDA and decision aspects as autonomous building blocks that form a full SOA, is a ground-breaking concept. This paper proposes an integrated model-driven solution method that will help develop service-oriented architectures while being aware of the need for decisions. Furthermore, our goal is to explore the standard models at every defined level; this is one of our primary reasons for utilizing the Service oriented architecture Modeling Language (SoaML) and the Decisional Model Notation (DMN) standard in designing several services. We also present a service taxonomy that defines the new set of concepts needed to model three dimensions. The proposed …",

The data warehouse (DW) is the main component of a data-driven DSS. In the field of DW design, many approaches exist but ignore external information and focus only on internal information coming from the operational sources. The existing approaches do not provide any instrument to take into account external information. In this paper, our objective is to introduce two models that will be employed in our approach: the requirement model and the environment model. These models are the basis of our DW design approach that supports external information. To evaluate the requirement model, we will illustrate with an example how to obtain external information useful for decision …",

This work is situated in the general context of stored information heterogeneity in a decisional system such as data, metadata and knowledge, for cohabitation and reconciliation of these information by mediation. Our Mapping approach focuses on computing semantic similarity between concepts of ontologies to merge, it is based on a weighted combination of computing similarity methods, we use syntactic, lexical, structural, and semantic technics. The proposed mapping process makes use of several types of information in a manner that increases the mapping accuracy.",

However, the content generated through ESN must undergo a lifting such as the quality control of the products or services developed in the organisation for its customers. This quality control of the exchanges between ESN users must focus on the quality of the shared knowledge for knowledge capitalisation purposes. To do this, we have proposed on the basis of an empirical study to incorporate within ESN a knowledge manager to certify the knowledge before sharing. This new ESN architecture has been validated by the success measurement model of knowledge management systems.",

To facilitate their activities, they use different types of annotations on the manipulated document. To exploit the benefits of these annotations, we propose in this paper, EI-Annotate, an annotation tool dedicated to economic intelligence actors, which enables them to create an adaptive collective memory.

It is usually handled by data flows processes that extract, transform, and clean data from several sources, and populate the data integration system (DIS). Designing data flows is facing several challenges. In this article, we deal with data quality issues such as (1) specifying a set of quality rules, (2) enforcing them on the data flow pipeline to detect violations, and (3) producing accurate repairs for the detected violations. We propose QDflows, a system for designing quality-aware data flows that considers the following as input: (1) a high-quality knowledge base (KB) as the global schema of integration, (2) a set of data sources and a set of validated users’ requirements, (3) a set of defined mappings between data sources and the KB, and (4) a set of quality rules specified by users. QDflows uses an ontology to design the DIS schema. It offers the …",

Cependant, de diverses difficultés se posent toujours, lors de la conception des SIE (Système d’Intelligence Economique). Ceci peut s’ expliquer par le manque de méthodes, car peu de travaux ont été réalisés dans le cadre méthodologique. Or, la plupart des écrits sur lesquelles nous nous reposons comme source d’information sont des constats des experts et rapport des hommes d’états, qui bien entendu, ignorent la dimension théorique du concept de l’IE.De ce fait, notre recherche s’ inscrit sur l’axe méthodologique pour la mise en œuvre de cette notion. Alors en nous basant sur l’exploitation de l’ingénierie des besoins pour l’amélioration de la phase «analyse des besoins» dans le cadre d’une une approche d’ingénierie des besoins pour la conception des SIE, nous présentons dans ce papier, un aperçu sur les méthodes déjà proposées pour la conception des SIE. Ensuite, en passant par la requalification d’un SIE à un système d’information d’IE (SI. IE), nous présenterons l’ingénierie des besoins dans les systèmes d’information, pour pouvoir la cerner en SI. IE. La suite de ce papier se focalisera sur la présentation d’une approche d’ingénierie des besoins pour la conception des SI. IE, en développant beaucoup plus l’aspect modélisation du besoin en IE.

Many approaches has been proposed in this field. Our focus is on goal-oriented approaches which are requirement-driven DW design approaches. We are interested in investigating to what extent these approaches went well with respect to the RE process. Thus, theoretical foundations about RE are presented, including the classical RE process. After that, goal-oriented DW design approaches are described briefly; and evaluation criteria, supporting a comparative study of these approaches, are provided.",

In this paper, we propose a semi-automatic approach for XML data warehouse design starting from XML schemas as data sources. The first step consists in automatically generating the UML Class diagram from W3C XML Schema (XSD). However, the obtained diagram can be very large and hard to understand. To overcome this situation, we use a set of rules based on basic techniques for …",

        "Description": "Over the past few years XML has rapidly become a widely accepted data format for information interchange and representation of semi-structured data. As a result, huge amounts of interesting data are generated and distributed on the Web, prompting the need of new and automated approaches to store, organize and analyze such data. Data warehouses systems provide an efficient tool and integrated repository with a high level of consolidation and a multi-dimensional view of the data. Several studies address the issue for designing a conceptual and logical schema of XML Data Warehouses. Nevertheless, these approaches focus only on identifying multidimensional concepts in a semi-automatic fashion. In this paper we propose an automatic approach for designing the logical schema for a data mart starting from the XML schema describing XML sources using UML and QVT transformation language.

Our research work aims to produce an approach for identifying useful information for decision-maker who is often confronted with decisional situations on strategic level. The target of this paper is to show how the risks management contributes to acquisition of useful information for the strategic decision-making. This approach relies on a process by using four models (the model of strategic objectives, the model of the tree of strategic objectives, the model of useful information and model of risks). It also proposes a language of analysis and decomposition of strategic objectives. To evaluate our approach, we present a case study about the process of response to call for tender (RCT).

It consists of using elements borrowed from games like points, badges and leader-boards to motivate employees for using information systems and improve their performance and productivity. Gamification gave promising results when applied to different domains like education, health, crowd-sourcing and banking among others. To implement and deploy gamification systems, different architectures were proposed to structure these new systems. However, none of these architectures consider the quality of data exchanged between the different components of the architecture. In this context, we propose an architectural framework for gamification systems based on web-sockets technology to guarantee a real time communication to better follow the behavior of the user.

Among this heterogeneous information are data that represent the analysis basis in DIS systems and metadata that represent a very important role to interpret the results and lead to a good analysis. In the current generation of DIS systems, we can find knowledge represented by ontologies, which is used to enjoy the semantic side offered by these systems. Our reconciliation model focuses on semantic mediation approach, based on the hybrid ontology architecture and semantic similarity measures to integrate each information type. Our modelling is based on a common model that represents a global view of heterogeneous information, allowing to find the mapping between different information types, to respond effectively to a posed query. To validate our work, we have applied …",

        "Description": "Knowledge management is to acquire and represent knowledge relevant to a domain, a task or a specific organization in order to facilitate access, reuse and evolution. This usually means build, maintain and evolve an explicit representation of knowledge. The next step is to provide access to that knowledge, that is to say, the spread in order to enable effective use. Knowledge management in the medical field aims to improve the performance of the medical organization by allowing individuals in the care facility (doctors, nurses, paramedics, etc...) to capture, share and apply collective knowledge in order to make optimal decisions in real time. In this paper we propose a knowledge management approach based on integration technique of heterogeneous data in the medical field by creating a data warehouse, a technique of extracting knowledge from medical data by choosing a technique of data mining, and finally an exploitation technique of that knowledge in a case-based reasoning system.",

Several new technologies have been introduced and even more are being currently researched and aimed to the future. To meet the goals of a successful SOA implementation, enterprises need to reconsider how they provision decision aspect. This paper puts forward one novel idea and architecture about how enterprises move to a new SOA which leverages with decision aspect. In this paper, the authors describe an extended Service-Oriented Architecture-SOAda for supporting a decision aspect. The authors also present our DMS meta-model (Decisional Model of the Service) to define a new set of concepts necessary for modeling the three levels: business, information and decision. Some of them are already known, whereas others are new and are proposed as an element …",

In this paper we focus on the heterogeneous metadata integration, with the definition of a structural and semantic mediation model. Our aim is to propose a mediation architecture for the heterogeneous sources metadata, represented by XML, RDF and RuleML model, providing to user the metadata transparency. This, by including data structures, of natures fundamentally different, and allowing the decomposition of a query involving multiple sources, to specific queries to these sources, then recompose the result. We use ontology for managing structural and semantic heterogeneity.",

In this paper, we have given a model for each field of assessment (engineering, ecology, logistics and risk management) for the creation of a company referential which is related to the durable product.

Our generic approach for ODSS design is based on the MUSIC (Management and Use of Co-operative Information Systems) model. An illustration of the approach is presented. The type of ODSS presented (risk estimation and management of innovative projects made during the bidding phase) is generic among process-oriented organizations.",

In this field, teachers, during their pedagogical activities, require more information found in different textual documents, tools, and databases. In addition, they organized several meetings and took considerable time to make appropriate and right decisions during the deliberation process.

The aim of the chapter is to improve decision making in the context of natural disasters situation. Zero risk in the world does not exist due to natural phenomena that occur randomly and appear suddenly. It is essential to manage the risks in the situation of natural disasters and also to confront the influence of natural disasters on the phenomenon of Soil-Structure Interaction. For this, this chapter presents a conceptual architecture of a knowledge base to manage the risks of natural disasters remotely by a Geographic Information system (GIS) and embedded systems. This architecture is based on the integration of data via different sources of information (GIS, satellites, electronic sensors and comments from experts). To properly manage this information, this chapter uses the ontology of Soil-Structure Interaction With Agents External (OSSIWAE) in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT). A case study is conducted on a prototype of a model for building a structure threestory for testing the usability of the proposed architecture.",

        "Description": "This paper presents an algorithm that computes the most common error types reported by teachers on students' lab reports in LabBook system. These common error types aim to improve students' learning by helping teachers to take necessary corrective actions. Computing the most common error types is not obvious because of their taxonomic structure. Thus, using frequencies of error types leads to select the uppermost type as the most common one. For this reason, two other parameters are taken into account in addition to the type frequency: a type generality level and a number of type subtypes. To define a computing algorithm, the most common error types are formalised with three rules where each rule uses one parameter. The algorithm proposed is based on ranking function that respects the three rules. It assigns a score to an error type by multiplying its frequency with a weight function based on information …",

Sur le marché, plusieurs outils d’aide à la décision prolifèrent. Pour rendre moins opaque ce marché, nous proposons une classification de ces outils. Ce travail de recherche est basé sur les classifications proposées par plusieurs chercheurs. Aussi, compte tenu de nombreuses publications, nous allons nous focaliser sur les travaux de DJ POWER, R. CHALAL et de G. FORGIONNE, pour proposer une nouvelle classification des systèmes d’information d’aide à la décision. Cette classification est basée sur une école de pensée «aider le décideur non pas le remplacer».",

        "Description": "Various models and methods are used to support the design process of SOA (Service Oriented Architecture), but still after many years of practice, there are a lot of questions and unsolved problems that cause the failure of SOA development projects. One of the reasons is that rapid changes in the business environment make it necessary to introduce the decision design, which should be efectively supported by SOA. Indeed, it is a big challenge to create a system that help the human resource development in industry to make their work easier without missing an opportunity to get a best employee. The objective of this study is to develop a decision making and Service Oriented Architecture for employee recruitment using analytic hierarchy process. This study explored the relationship between SOA and decision making during the recruitment process. To achieve our goal, we use the new method SOA+ d to develop the SOA architecture. Also we provide the decision using the new standard Decision Model and Notation (DMN). The novelty of the proposed approach is in the a) the formal definition of a complete set of proposed services b) the uses of standards language and notation in each dimension of approach c) the specification of the mappings rules to identify a set of services. We illustrate the proposed approach with a real case study of the Recruitment and Selection in SAAD DAHLAB University.",

Parmi ces concepts on distingue la gestion de la mobilité qui est due à l’émergence des réseaux sans fil et la gestion de la qualité de service dans le but d’opérer de nouvelles applications sur ce réseau. Les premières solutions de la gestion de la mobilité consistaient seulement à maintenir la connexion du mobile pendant que celui-ci change de point d’attachement au réseau. Cette solution ne tient pas compte de la gestion de la qualité de service offerte par le réseau au nouveau point d’attachement. Dans un réseau mobile offrant une qualité de service, la durée nécessaire à l’accomplissement de la nouvelle connexion est importante, cependant, si le mobile doit s’ authentifier et si le réseau doit aussi installer la qualité de service à chaque changement de point d’attachement, la niveau de service se voit …",

L'approche de résolution proposée est basée sur un mécanisme de coopération inter-ressources où les négociations sont initiées entre les agents afin d'assurer une cohérence entre tout couple de tâches liées par la gamme opératoire.

This problem is of crucial importance in the field of social network analysis. The goal of our paper is to classify existing methods dealing with the issue. We propose a classification of various methods for tracking community evolution in dynamic social networks into four main approaches using as a criterion the functioning principle: the first one is based on independent successive static detection and matching; the second is based on dependent successive static detection; the third is based on simultaneous study of all stages of community evolution; finally, the fourth and last one concerns methods working directly on temporal networks.

To start with, the dynamic network is split into a series of timeframes, each one containing interactions aggregated over a time period such as a month, a day or an hour. Splitting the network into timeframes is of crucial importance to capture the right communities' temporal evolution before predicting their future. Our paper investigates the problem of choosing the appropriate scale for network splitting which would improve the prediction. The experiments we conducted on Facebook and Higgs Twitter datasets offer strong empirical evidence of the usefulness of considering the appropriate network splitting as a first step in predicting community evolution in dynamic social networks.",

Studies on tracking and predicting community evolution generally split these networks into time-series of static networks, each including interactions aggregated over discrete time intervals (hours, days, and years). This choice of intervals is very often done arbitrarily. Yet, it is clear that the selection of the time interval over which the network is discretized has a great impact on the observation of community structures, the analysis of their evolution, and the prediction of their future events. In this paper, we propose a new framework that examines users’ activity distribution over time to provide the appropriate network splitting that would produce more accurate community event prediction.

In this study, we propose a cuckoo search-based approach for identifying the best network partitions by maximizing the modularity function. The proposed algorithm combines wisely the continuous nature of the standard cuckoo search algorithm with the discrete nature of the community detection problem to achieve the best results. Firstly, the algorithm incorporates the random key representation, which operates in a continuous space. This representation enables the algorithm to perform global and local walks, enabling both exploration and exploitation within the search space. Secondly, the algorithm utilizes the locusbased representation to handle the discrete aspect of the community detection problem. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm.",

        "Description": "This paper aims to introduce a novel modularity-based framework, Com_Tracker, designed to detect and track community structures in dynamic social networks without recomputing them from scratch at each snapshot. Despite extensive research in this area, existing approaches either require repetitive computations or fail to capture key community behavioral events, both of which limit the ability to generate timely and actionable insights. Efficiently tracking community structures is crucial for real-time decision-making in rapidly evolving networks, while capturing behavioral events is necessary for understanding deeper community dynamics. This study addresses these limitations by proposing a more efficient and adaptive solution. It aims to answer the following questions: How can we efficiently track community structures without recomputation? How can we detect significant community events over time …",

This paper addresses the challenge of community detection in multiplex networks, which model multiple types of relationships to reflect reality. Our approach consists of two key steps. First, we employ multiplex network flattening techniques to transform it into a one-dimensional network. Second, we introduce a cuckoo searchbased algorithm to maximize the modularity function and identify the best network partitions. Our algorithm strategically combines the continuous aspects of the standard cuckoo search algorithm with the discrete nature of community detection, to achieve better results. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world multiplex networks demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.",

        "Description": "This paper presents, BSODCS, a Bee Swarm Optimization for detecting community structure within networks. It employs artificial bees to explore a search space and construct solutions for community detection. To accommodate the specific features of networks, we adopt a locus-based adjacency encoding scheme. Each bee makes decisions regarding its neighboring solutions and shares information through a dance. To explore the neighborhood of each bee, we use Pearson’s correlation as the heuristic information. The modularity of the bees’ solutions serves as a metric for evaluating their quality. The algorithm is tested on well-known real-world networks, and the experimental findings demonstrate that BSODCS outperforms other existing swarm-based methods, delivering higher-quality results.",

        "Description": "With its various real-life applications, predicting community evolution is a challenging task in the field of social network analysis. In this paper, we analyze communities’ evolution prediction accuracy in dynamic social networks. The proposed approach combines two key concepts of the process, aiming to enrich the prediction model by additional information that could improve the results:(1) a tailored network splitting that results in snapshots of different periods rather than a static one, and (2) the change rates of communities’ features that characterize them over time instead of absolute values of features. Our experiments on four realworld social networks confirm that community evolution prediction can be achieved with a very high accuracy by using both tailored network splitting as a first step of prediction process and change rates of features.",

Reference ontology is able to contribute significantly in reducing the issue of ontology applications specificity. Particularly considering higher education domain, we think that a reference ontology dedicated to this knowledge area, can be regarded as a valuable tool for several stakeholders interested in analyzing the system of higher education as a whole, especially in a context of academic systems diversity all over the world. Motivated by this potential application and even more, we decided to build a reference ontology called HERO ontology, which stands for “Higher Education Reference Ontology”. In this paper we explain HERO ontology building process from requirements specification until ontology evaluation using NeOn methodology.",

        "Description": "Ontology validation is an important part of measuring the quality of an ontology, and the best way to assure the accuracy of the knowledge encoded in the ontology. One of the earliest approaches toward ontology evaluation was the introduction of competency questions, ie, natural language questions that the ontology should be able to answer. Since the ontology is a machine readable representation of knowledge, end-users should be able to query it using a formal language, such as SPARQL; however, translating natural language competency questions into SPARQL queries is not a trivial task. In the scope of this paper, we consider competency questions of HERO (Higher Education Reference Ontology) ontology we have developed. We translated these competency questions into SPARQL queries using a variation of a known approach.",

By contrast, knowledge-intensive processes (KIPs) have not been effectively supported yet. This paper proposes a data-centric and goal-driven approach that enables flexible KIP enactment with dynamically evolving task structure and varying task granularity. The approach utilises artificial intelligence planning techniques in order to enable recommendations regarding the next tasks to be enacted. Furthermore, recommendations may be dynamically adapted when mismatches between the digital process and the real-world KIP emerge. Overall, the approach provides flexibility and guidance during KIP enactment.",

Though before performing such a reuse, it is essential to distinguish clearly which type of resource we are dealing with and therefore decide for its suitability for our purposes or not.

Reference ontology is able to contribute significantly in resolving or at least reducing the issue of ontology applications specificity and hence increasing ontology reusability. Particularly considering higher education domain, we think that a reference ontology dedicated to this knowledge area, can be regarded as a valuable tool for researchers and institutional employees interested in analyzing the system of higher education as a whole. This paper describes, a reference ontology called HERO ontology, which stands for “Higher Education Reference Ontology”. We explain HERO ontology building process from requirements specification until ontology evaluation using NeOn methodology. HERO ontology is projected to be a reusable and generalisable resource of academic knowledge which can be filtered to meet the needs of any knowledge-based application that requires structural information. It is distinct from application ontologies in that it is not intended as an end-user application and does not target the needs of any particular user group.

This paper proposes a modeling approach and a generic CRM model for the simulation of the value generated by information and communication technologies. The model must have a sufficient level of accuracy to achieve meaningful and helpful results, while maintaining a sufficiently generic level of abstraction to allow rapid implementation.",

        "Description": "Business process integration (BPI) is a crucial technique for supporting inter-organizational business interoperability. BPI allows automation of business processes and the integration of systems across numerous organizations. The integration of organizations' process models is one of the most addressed and used approach to achieve BPI. However, this model integration is complex and requires that designers have extensive experience in particular when organizations' business processes are incompatible. This paper considers the issue of modeling cross-organization processes out of a collection of organizations' private process models. To this end, we propose six adaptation patterns to resolve incompatibilities when combining organizations' processes. Each pattern is formalized with workflow net.",

This dynamic and complex environment exposes it to a complicated climate leading to crisis and disaster situations. Since crisis is a situation requiring quick and efficient collaborative decisions with high degree of uncertainty and complexity, the role of information and knowledge seems to be of potential relevance. This paper aims to discuss and analyze several important aspects and issues of collaborative crisis and disaster management and to highlight the literature's contributions in reacting to such. We propose a meta-model serving as a framework for classifying the reviewed literature works.",

In order to reach timely and appropriate decisions, crisis response organizations need to rapidly obtain an accurate situation awareness of the crisis context. A process by which they need to gather, access, and exchange near real-time information about the events circumstances throughout the entire crisis life cycle. Such activities imply a huge participation of collaborating organizations and goes even beyond their internal borders to reach the entire crisis-stricken community. Recent crisis and disaster situations have demonstrated the crucial role citizens can and must play in responding to such events. The growing development of advanced technologies has open the door for large public to be a key factor in making decisions and conducting guided response actions. We propose in this …",

The aim of this paper is twofold. On one hand, we propose a generic approach that integrates an ontology into a software system and on the other hand we demonstrate its feasibility and usefulness by carrying out a real world case study; namely, a competency location system for a computer science school.",

This movement aims to adopt a unified format, understandable by machines and easily discoverable and exploitable. As a result of this success, there has been a continuous expansion of linked open data available on the cloud. However, a limited number of applications utilize this wealth of data. Therefore, several governmental initiatives were launched to encourage the exploitation and use of public utility data to create applications that improve citizens' lives. This work investigates how linked open data, including government data, can provide public utility applications. Furthermore, this paper proposes a generic approach for creating mobile and web apps based on linked open data.",

Hence, ensuring ontological quality is considered a crucial issue. One of the well-known domain ontologies validation approaches proposes a set of competency questions, covering the domain represented by the ontology, translating these questions into SPARQL queries, running them on the ontology, and comparing the obtained results with the expected ones. This paper presents an approach to translate natural language competency questions into SPARQL queries to assist domain experts in testing ontologies and users considering exploring ontologies for further exploitation. The implementation and experimentation of the proposed approach are described. The resulting tool proposes a fully automatic and semi-automatic execution, enabling end-users to parameter the approach phases.",

These features can be used to recognize the learner’s emotional state during the learning session; very important feedback that has been lost in e-Learning mode in comparison to in-school learning mode. This study investigates the relationship between the learner’s emotional state during the learning session and the colors he chooses for his annotations. The study finds its motivation, first, in the strong link between emotions and cognitive processes, and second, in the richness of learner’s annotation as an object. The experiment was designed to generate multiple emotional states. We collected learners’ annotations and learners’ emotional feedback.

This paper examines the opportunity of using spatial data warehousing technique in the OH management framework to integrate various data formats such as geographic (workplace data) and thematic data which are usually scattered across multiple, dispersed and fragmented systems. We propose a SOLAP architecture that supports the whole process of risk management for prevention purposes.

        "Description": "Nowadays organizations collaborate through cross-organizational business processes. These business processes require the coordination of several partners who are often geographically dispersed. Modeling such processes is complex and requires that designers have extensive experience in particular when organizations’ processes are incompatible. This paper addresses the problem of modeling cross-organization processes out of collection of organizations private process models. To this end, we propose a set of process adaptation patterns that connect private processes and resolve interoperability issues. Proposed patterns are formalized with workflow net.",

        "Description": "Business process integration (BPI) allows organizations to connect and automate their business processes in order to deliver the right economic resources at the right time, place, and price. BPI requires the integration of business processes and their supporting systems across multiple autonomous organizations. However, such integration is complex and can face coordination complexities that occur during the resource exchanges between the partners’ processes. This article proposes a new method called Process Mining for Business Process Integration (PM4BPI) that helps process designers to perform BPI by creating new process models that cross the boundaries of multiple organizations from a collection of process event logs. PM4BPI uses federated process mining techniques to detect incompatibilities before the integration of the partners’ processes. Then, it applies process adaptation patterns to solve …",

However, case studies of ontologies describing enterprise business models have rarely been reported in the literature, although there are a few indications of the impact of these ontologies on business models; however, these indications do not ease the assessment of the added value of this type of ontology. The aim of this paper is two-fold; on one hand, we highlight the lack of task-based assessment of enterprise business model ontologies via some concrete case studies, and on the other hand, we aim to tackle this issue by proposing indicators intended for measuring the impact of business model ontologies in the framework of enterprise business models.",

This research explores ontologies' potential to solve data heterogeneity (risks, accidents, occupational diseases, preventive and corrective measures) in the OHS field. The paper presents an ontology-driven approach for OHS exploiting an ontology reuse methodology adapted to the SMT Company, a Sonelgaz Group subsidiary. We also provide SMT managers with an integrated application for better decision-making in occupational health.",

This initiative can create value by linking data describing the same phenomenon from different perspectives using the traditional Web and semantic web technologies. A framework of these technologies is linked data movement that guides the publication of data and their interconnection in a machine-readable means enabling automatic interpretation and exploitation. Nevertheless, Open Government Data publication as Linked Open Data (LOD) is not a trivial task due to several obstacles, such as data heterogeneity issues. Many works dealing with this transformation process have been published that need to be investigated thoroughly to deduce the general trends and the issues related to this field. The current work proposes a classification of existing methods dealing with OGD-LOD transformation and a synthesis study to highlight their main trends and challenges.",

With the growing development of collaborative technologies, citizen participation to the crisis management process has shifted from the passive one-way contribution of social networking data to a more active participation by performing specific tasks related to crisis data processing. This article presents a comprehensive approach for integrating the crowdsourcing process to the collaborative decisional process in crisis situations. Within the approach three aspects are highlighted: the coordination work that exists between the relevant stakeholders in making collective decisions, the modeling of case dependent activities within the decisional process, and the detailed modeling of decision-related tasks.

        "Description": "Managing crises is considered as one of the most complicated organizational and managerial task. Indeed, dealing with such situations calls for many groups from different institutions and organizations to interact and collaborate their efforts in a timely manner to reduce their effects. However, response organizations are challenged by several problems. The urgent need of a shared and mutual situational awareness, information and knowledge about the situation are distributed across time and space and owned by both organizations and people. Additionally, decisions and actions have to be achieved promptly, under stress and time pressure. The contribution outlined in this paper is suggesting a crowdsourcing-based approach for decision making in collaborative crisis management based on the literature requirements. The objective of the approach is to support situational awareness and enhance the decision making process by involving citizens in providing opinions and evaluations of potential response actions.",

En effet, l’évaluation d’une ontologie avant et après son application dans le cadre d’une entreprise, mobiliserait une équipe d’experts sur une période qui reste à déterminer et sans garantie de résultats. Pour cela, il est primordial de sélectionner la méthode de simulation la plus adaptée à nos besoins. Dans le cadre du présent travail de recherche, nous avons entrepris de réaliser un benchmarking des approches de simulation les plus populaires et de mettre leurs caractéristiques respectives à l’épreuve de nos contraintes.",

We use then this generated knowledge to create knowledge-driven cartographies. School websites are essential to share information and data between users, but the knowledge contained in these websites are often informal and difficult to locate. This is due to the large amount of existing pages which make navigation more complex. Then, to simplify knowledge localization, we map the school website content and generate ontology-driven visual cartographies where users can find the school teachers' skills and knowledge. Our automatic method and tool enables us to process a large collection of web pages in a short time. Our method comprises four steps: data preparation, ontology domain construction, mapping and visualization.",

Risk Management in the OHS field is a data‐driven process. However, geospatial data has not been fully considered and few works have used visualization for decision‐making purposes. Our research was conducted using a design science research methodology. It is a methodology for creating and evaluating IT artifacts to solve identified organizational problems. We used Wang's safety intelligence framework and the recommendations of the ISO 45001 model from extant literature to inform the Design. While creating our artifact, we chose to make an inventory of occupational risk prevention practices in Algeria. A qualitative study using interviews with experts in the field consolidated the requirements for such a system. The key findings from the analysis of collected data state that …",

In this age of advanced collaborative technologies, citizens' participation to the crisis management process has shifted from the passive one-way contribution of social networking data to more active participation by performing specific tasks related to crisis-data processing. This chapter presents a comprehensive approach for integrating the crowdsourcing process to the collaborative decisional process in crisis situations. Application of the proposal with a real-world case study of the desert locust plague provides evidence of the enabling role that the crowdsourcing paradigm plays in supporting decision makers within desert locust control …",

Thus, the full potential of the web is not being used. With the aim to address this issue, Tim Berners Lee proposed some of the best practices to publish data on the web, known as the linked data principles, enabling machines to interpret the semantics of data correctly and therefore infer new facts and return relevant results of web research. This paper is a systematic literature review on existing approaches to transform web open data to linked data. A classification of these approaches is proposed, as well as a synthesis study to highlight approaches' main trends and challenges.",

While IT actors manage technical issues of internal and external sources, a new actor has emerged “the Chief Data Officer” (CDO), the role of which is to align and prioritize data activities with key organizational priorities and goals. Existing literature managing the incorporation of LOD in internal Data cubes mainly focus on technical aspects of the LOD source and ignores the CDO role in this strategy. In this paper, we claim that technical actions should be conducted by the managerial level, which is reflected through the goals of the organization data cube and their related Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). For doing this, we first propose a metamodel aligning the three models: the data-flow model, the goal model and the KPI model. Then …",

Our computer science school (ESI) aims to be proactive to the demands of the market; hence, a cognitive map of intra-organizational skills is required. In this work, we propose to include the semantic perspective to our current competence location system by building an application ontology which will control specifically the used vocabulary and hopefully increase the whole system effectiveness. In order to achieve these goals, we propose a new system architecture of which the most crucial element is an application ontology dedicated to the localization of intra-school skills.",

        "Description": "The activity of durable product design satisfying the implicit and explicit customer requirements forebode the important part of the assessment and the necessity of having gradually a precise representation of the conception. This assessment in the company is represented by a set of analysis that has to be performed for the purpose of defining a durable product, which meets the customer expectations. In this paper, we have given a model for each field of assessment (engineering, ecology, logistics and risk management) for the creation of a company referential which is related to the durable product. Software architecture is proposed to focus the assessment and facilitate the cooperation between the intervening parts within the framework of the simultaneous conception.",

It empowers developers to harness open-source data, creating practical and beneficial citizen applications.The LOD-GePEx approach is a three-step process. First, it transforms OGD into LOD, adhering to the four LD principles. Second, it publishes the generated LOD in the OGD portal, following accessibility best practices. Third, it exploits the published LOD through an interface that offers multiple services. In addition, this paper carried out functional and performance tests to prove the proposed approach’s effectiveness and performance.The evaluation phase demonstrated that the LOD-GePEx approach is effective and efficient. It transforms OGD into LOD with …",

As governments, being among the largest producers and collectors of data, are making OGD available online in diverse formats, primarily Word, PDF, or Excel, they are contributing significantly to this global initiative. The OGD initiative holds immense potential to revolutionize the way we access and use government data. Its primary objective is to enhance the discoverability, accessibility, and availability of data in alternative and preferably machine-readable formats. This, in turn, empowers a diverse set of stakeholders to develop innovative data applications under licensing schemes that permit unrestricted reuse. Despite these promising aspects, challenges such as data heterogeneity, data protection, data quality, and data provenance issues persist. This study aims to analyze and categorize these challenges and obstacles that hinder the OGD initiative from realizing its full potential, with a particular emphasis on data protection and security concerns for data providers.",

        "Description": "AI, cybersecurity, cloud computing, and robotics are becoming ubiquitous technologies in the industry sector, which has witnessed several successive industrial revolutions: mechanization, electrification, digitalization, and now Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 refers to the technologies reinventing manufacturing practices, leading to smart factories where systems, machines, and products communicate constantly. To implement I4.0 successfully, companies must manage, control, and contain many changes and risks. As a result, organizations must ensure that introducing these new technologies is valuable, determine what challenges they face and what opportunities they can take advantage of, and anticipate their future needs and the conditions to implement to optimize their resources. In addition, the enterprise architecture can contribute to the good governance of I4.0 technologies within an enterprise. Using an enterprise architecture, a company can better understand its current situation, capabilities, and how it interacts with its environment. This enables it to align IT with business needs and assess the need to adopt new technologies for any organization with strategic goals. Specifically, this study aims to determine how TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework) could assist companies in assessing the necessity of implementing Industry 4.0 technologies. Specifically, the study explores the factors influencing the company's transformation, the potential benefits of I4.0 technologies, and the phases and artifacts stakeholders should consider when adopting I4.0.",

        "Description": "Avec la multiplication des sources LOD (Linked Open Data ou don-nées ouvertes et liées), les organisations ont vu l'opportunité d'étendre leurs cubes de données internes avec ce type de données externes. Les sources LOD sont certes porteuses d'une réelle valeur ajoutée, mais elles ont apporté leur lot de difficultés techniques liées à la gestion de ces données (flux ETL, volume des données, qualité de la source, etc.). Nous constatons dans la littérature existante, que la décision d'incorporer les LOD dans un cube se concentre sur la gestion de ces difficultés techniques, alors que cette décision est avant tout'organisa-tionnelle'. Cette omission s' explique par le fait que l'intégration des LOD est étudiée selon une vision orientée sources, alors qu'une vision orientée besoins serait plus adéquate pour étudier efficacement la pertinence de l'intégration de cette nouvelle source. Dans cet article, nous apportons une vision organisationnelle orientée buts dans laquelle les indicateurs de performance clés (key Performance Indicators-KPI-) sont l'élément central liant les sources de données aux objectifs organisationnels. Nous proposons une approche orientée buts permettant d'estimer la valeur organisationnelle (via les valeurs des KPI) des ressources LOD dans le cube. L'approche est basée sur un méta-modèle alignant les trois modèles: le modèle de données, le modèle de buts et le modèle KPI. Des expérimentations sont menées pour valider notre approche.",

However, case studies of ontologies describing enterprise business models have rarely been reported in the literature, although there are a few indications of the impact of these ontologies on business models; however, these indications do not ease the assessment of the added value of this type of ontology. The aim of this paper is two-fold; on one hand, we highlight the lack of task-based assessment of enterprise business model ontologies via some concrete case studies, and on the other hand, we aim to tackle this issue by proposing indicators intended for measuring the impact of business model ontologies in the framework of enterprise business models.",

        "Description": "Dans un contexte d’affaire, l’agilité fait référence à la capacité qu’une organisation à réponde rapidement (productivité, réduction des coûts) aux changements imposés par le marché et l’environnement [BADOT, 1997]. Et puis, les interactions à tous les niveaux apparaissent comme une réelle force pour les entreprises agiles, car des idées nouvelles, produits, services voire solutions émergent des multiples échanges qui se passent au sein des organisations et plus particulièrement les processus business. Les interactions au même titre que l’environnement externe, sont les moteurs de l’innovation et du changement dans les organisations agiles.Nous nous sommes intéressés aux réseaux sociaux d’entreprise qui sont centrés davantage sur les personnes et les relations qu'elles peuvent entretenir que sur des processus de travail. L’objet de ce travail est de répondre à la question suivante:\" en quoi ces réseaux sociaux d’entreprise sont susceptibles d'influencer l’agilité d’une organisation?\".",

        "Description": "Une école d’ingénieurs se doit de stocker, manipuler et présenter toutes sortes d’informations et de connaissances nécessaires à son bon fonctionnement (sur les étudiants, les stagiaires, les enseignants et enseignants-chercheurs, la production pédagogique et scientifique, le personnel et ses relations avec l’environnement,…). Nous nous intéressons particulièrement à l’activité «encadrement & suivi de stagiaires» complexe, exigeante, où le tacite prend souvent le dessus sur l’explicite. Les interactions multiples entre enseignants, enseignants et professionnels durant le suivi des stages constituent souvent la clé de la réussite du projet tant sur le plan académique que sur le plan professionnel.Toutefois, la réalité dévoile souvent un cloisonnement voire un isolement de l’encadreur face à ses stagiaires alors que le besoin d’impliquer d’autre personnes dans ce travail d’encadrement se fait souvent par à coups, selon des affinités, sans toutefois tirer profit des expériences parallèles qui représenteraient un capital de savoir et savoir-faire d’une utilité indéniable.",

It probes the use of computing to improve education and learning in a variety of settings, platforms and environments.\n\nThe journal aims to provide perspectives at all levels, from the micro level of specific pedagogical approaches in Computing Education and applications or instances of use in classrooms, to macro concerns of national policies and major projects; from pre-school classes to adults in tertiary institutions; from teachers and administrators to researchers and designers; from institutions to online and lifelong learning. The journal is embedded in the research and practice of professionals within the contemporary global context and its breadth and scope encourage debate on fundamental issues at all levels and from different research paradigms and learning theories.\n\nThe journal does not proselytize on behalf of the technologies (whether they be mobile, desktop, interactive, virtual, games-based or learning management systems) but rather provokes debate on all the complex relationships within and between computing and education, whether they are in informal or formal settings. It probes state of the art technologies in Computing Education and it also considers the design and evaluation of digital educational artefacts.",

In particular image mosaicing is used to assemble several overlapping images in order to constitute the global frame. We will focus on a feature-point matching method to perform the mosaicing. The SIFT algorithm is used to extract the feature points in both images. The mosaicing result is obtained after transforming the sensed or target image to align to the reference image. Performing a mosaicing operation is not sufficient to claim reaching the goal. Objective metrics must be used to evaluate the resulting mosaic. In this paper we present a complete mosaicing system named EsiReg and give a brief comparative insight on results of stitching satellite and aerial images using well known performance metrics.",

        "Description": "Medical imaging applications produce large sets of similar images. The huge amount of data makes the manual analysis and interpretation a fastidious task. Medical image segmentation is thus an important process in image processing used to partition the images into different regions (eg gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)). Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) Model and Gibbs distributions provide powerful tools for image modeling. In this paper, we use a HMRF model to perform segmentation of volumetric medical images. We have a problem with incomplete data. We seek the segmented images according to the MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) criterion. MAP estimation leads to the minimization of an energy function. This problem is computationally intractable. Therefore, optimizations techniques are used to compute a solution. We will evaluate the segmentation upon two major factors: the time of calculation and the quality of segmentation. Processing time is reduced by distributing the computation of segmentation on a powerful and inexpensive architecture that consists of a cluster of personal computers. Parallel programming was done by using the standard MPI (Message Passing Interface).",

With the huge number of medical images, the manual analysis and interpretation became a tedious task. Thus, automatic image segmentation became essential for diagnosis assistance. Segmentation consists in dividing the image into homogeneous and significant regions. We focus on hidden Markov random fields referred to as HMRF to model the problem of segmentation. This modelisation leads to a classical function minimisation problem. Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm referred to as BFGS is one of the most powerful methods to solve unconstrained optimisation problem. In this paper, we investigate the combination of HMRF and BFGS algorithm to perform the segmentation operation.

        "Description": "Dans le domaine de l'imagerie médicale, la segmentation des images est une tâche cruciale, qui permet d’isoler dans l’image les objets significatifs sur lesquels doit porter l’analyse. Elle fournit donc au praticien une aide à la décision pour effectuer son diagnostic. La pertinence de cet outil repose principalement sur la qualité de segmentation. Diverses techniques ont été proposées pour répondre au mieux à cette problématique. L'appréciation visuelle, même si elle indicative, ne garantit pas la supériorité d'une méthode par rapport à une autre. Des critères objectifs sont communément utilisés pour comparer les diverses techniques sur des images dont la segmentation est connue a priori.Du fait de l'inexistence d’une méthode universelle de segmentation, l'objectif de nos travaux est de fournir une méthode de segmentation très efficace en termes de qualité de segmentation. Dans nos travaux, nous avons utilisé la modélisation par champs aléatoires de Markov cachés HMRF (Hidden Markov Random Fields) pour poser le problème de la segmentation des images. Cette modélisation robuste et\" élégante\" aboutit à l’optimisation d’une fonction objectif. Une méthode d'optimisation s' impose donc pour obtenir la segmentation finale. Nous avons utilisé diverses techniques d’optimisation que sont le Recuit Simulé, la méthode des modes conditionnels itérés ICM (Iterated Conditional Modes), la méthode de Nelder-Mead, la méthode de Torczon, la méthode de BFGS et la méthode des essaims particulaires PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization).

        "Description": "Medical imaging applications produce large sets of similar images. The huge amount of data makes the manual analysis and interpretation a fastidious task. Medical image segmentation is thus an important process in image processing used to partition the images into different regions (eg gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid). Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) Model and Gibbs distributions provide powerful tools for image modeling. In this paper, we use a HMRF model to perform segmentation of volumetric medical images. We have a problem with incomplete data. We seek the segmented images according to the MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) criterion. MAP estimation leads to the minimization of an energy function. This problem is computationally intractable. Therefore, optimizations techniques are used to compute a solution. We will evaluate the segmentation upon two major factors: the time of calculation and the quality of segmentation. Processing time is reduced by distributing the computation of segmentation on a powerful and inexpensive architecture that consists of a cluster of personal computers. Parallel programming was done by using the standard MPI (Message Passing Interface).",

D’où la nécessité des systèmes automatiques de segmentation médicale, une tâche cruciale qui consiste à diviser une image numérique en plusieurs segments dont le but est de simplifier et de changer sa représentation en quelque chose de plus significatif et plus facile à analyser par l’humain, afin d’apporter une aide permettant au praticien de poser le diagnostic le plus adéquat.",

Segmentation is one of key operations to provide a decision support to physicians. There are several methods to perform segmentation. We use Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) for modelling the segmentation problem. This elegant model leads to an optimization problem. Particles Swarm Optimization (PSO) method is used to achieve brain magnetic resonance image segmentation. Setting the parameters of the HMRF-PSO method is a task in itself. We conduct a study for the choice of parameters that give a good segmentation. The segmentation quality is evaluated on ground-truth images, using the Dice coefficient also called Kappa index. The results show a superiority of the HMRF-PSO method, compared to methods such as Classical MRF and MRF using variants of ACO (Ant Colony Optimization).",

HMRFs model the segmentation problem as a minimization of an energy function. CS algorithm is one of the recent powerful optimization techniques. Therefore, five variants of the CS algorithm are used to compute a solution. Through tests, we conduct a study to choose the CS variant with parameters that give good results (execution time and quality of segmentation). CS variants are evaluated and compared with non-destructive testing (NDT) images using a misclassification error (ME) criterion.",

That segments the brain images into different tissue types (Grey Matter, White Matter, and Cerebro Spinal Fluid) in order to help physicians to determine easily the final decision. The underlying method is based on hidden Markov random fields to extract image features for using them as inputs of our neural network model. IBSR images with their ground-truth are used to train and evaluate our model. The quality of segmentation is measured by using the Dice coefficient metric. Setting the parameters of the DL-HMRF model is a task in itself. We have generated six models with different parameters to select the one that gives the best segmentation. Through tests, the selected model shows excellent results in terms of the quality of segmentation and execution time.",

They provide an approximate solution, close to the optimum, for complex problems (NP-hard problems). The performance guarantees of these methods vary depending on the chosen parameter values. However, selecting parameter values that yield good performance is a challenging task. Since the 1950s, Genichi Taguchi, a Japanese engineer, has developed robust design techniques to improve the quality of manufactured goods. Recently, these techniques have found applications in various domains, including engineering and biotechnology. In this paper, we investigate the application of the Taguchi design for the first time to simplify the process of selecting suitable parameter values for Elephant Herding Optimization (EHO) variants.

Notre objectif est de développer une méthodologie qui doit être à la fois assez précise et assez simple pour les nécessités de déploiements à grande échelle que l'utilisation croissante de la vidéo sur IP est susceptible d'exiger. A cette fin, nous nous concentrerons sur l'élaboration d'une approche qui est capable d’analyser les statistiques du réseau et d’en trouver les corrélations, par exemple, la perte de paquets (disponible à partir de mesures simples) à la qualité de la vidéo séquence reconstruite par les récepteurs. Une étape dans cette direction est un modèle de la perte de distorsion qui tient compte de l'impact des pertes du réseau sur la qualité vidéo.

Sat domain benefits from the appearance of powerful solvers that can process huge amounts of data in short times. This paper proposes to solve supervised learning problems expressed as Sat ones. This is done to take advantage of an existing environment that allows experimenting different heuristics, such as: tabu search, genetic algorithm, ant colonies, etc., in order to extract solutions that satisfy a maximum number of clauses (Max-Sat problem).

        "Description": "Wireless instrumentation systems are a collection of resource-constrained nodes in charge of sensing, processing, and transmitting data. They are often battery powered, and consequently, subject to energy constraints. Since communication is the most energy-consuming task, efforts have to be made during the routing process in order to maximize the network lifespan and avoid network partitioning. In this context, the multi-wireless-agent communication (MWAC) model provides a self-organization process for managing communication in this kind of instrumentation system. Given an organization and a node, MWAC determines a single path to route messages to the destination. This may cause congestions for large data flows. This paper introduces antMWAC, a model designed to improve MWAC. Ant colony optimization is used to balance the traffic load on wireless nodes and insure a multipath routing. Ants …",

Our IEEE Systems Council job is to address issues in new ways that are not solvable in the domains of the existing IEEE or other societies or global organizations. These problems do not fit within traditional hierarchical boundaries. For example, disaster response such as that triggered by Hurricane Katrina, tsunamis, or current volcanic eruptions is not solvable by pure engineering solutions.

        "Description": "Decision Support Systems (DSS) are a constantly growing area. More and more domains of the daily life take advantage of the available tools (medicine, trade, meteorology…). However, such tools are confronted to a particular problem: the great number of characteristics that qualify data samples. They are more or less victims of the abundance of information.Sat domain benefits from the appearance of powerful solvers that can process huge amounts of data in short times. This paper presents an approach for translating timetable problems (which are a particular case of DSS), into a Boolean formula, which is then provided to an environment that allows experimenting different heuristics in order to extract solutions that satisfy a maximum number of clauses (Max-Sat problem). Finally, the best solutions are back-translated into the original problem in order to find an adequate schedule that satisfies the characteristics and constraints of the timetable problem.",

However, the media never stopped reporting phishing and identity theft attacks held by third-party entities that rely on domain names to mislead Internet users. Thus, Palo Alto Networks revealed in their studies 20 largely cyber-squatted domain names targeting popular brands. Based on their behavior, domain names appear in public lists that objectively evaluate their reputation. Blacklists contain domain names that have previously committed suspicious acts, whereas whitelists include the most popular and trustworthy domain names. For a long time, this listing technique has been used as a reactive approach to counter domain name-based attacks. However, it suffers from the limitation of responding late to attacks. Nowadays, techniques tend to be much more proactive. They operate before any attack occurs. As part of the CSNET …",

As a result, the substance of Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) problems and solutions have changed. Various data collection methods have also become possible through advanced technologies like IoT and wearable devices. Managing the big data produced by these multiple sources is now necessary. Many works introduced Big data-based solutions to deal with increasing data volume. However, spatial data were not explicitly considered in such solutions. The main objective of this paper is to highlight the need to integrate the spatial dimension into individual and continuous occupational risk exposure monitoring. To this end, we present a typical architecture of an integrated system taking advantage of the technological levers introduced by the Industry 4.0 phenomenon (IoT and spatial Big Data technologies).

Occupational Risk Management Process, is characterized by multiple types of data (activity sector, occupations, risks exposures, diseases, etc.).

This paper examines the opportunity of using spatial data warehousing technique in the OH management framework to integrate various data formats such as geographic (workplace data) and thematic data which are usually scattered across multiple, dispersed and fragmented systems. We propose a SOLAP architecture that supports the whole process of risk management for prevention purposes. We then instantiate the architecture to build a SOLAP-Based System for SMT Company to enhance risk assessment in OH for electrical and gas industries.",

        "Description": "This work focuses on the problem of scheduling jobs on a single machine that requires flexible maintenance under human resource competence and availability constraints. To solve the problem we developed two fuzzy genetic algorithms that are based on respectively the sequential and total scheduling strategies. The one respecting the sequential strategy consists in two phases. In the first phase, the integrated production and maintenance schedules are generated. In the second one, the human resources are assigned to maintenance activities. The second algorithm respecting a total strategy consists in generating the integrated production and maintenance schedules that explicitly satisfy the human resource constraints. In regard to these two different strategies, we studied then two integrated fuzzy genetic algorithms that use the fuzzy logic framework to deal with the uncertain nature of both production and …",

PM activities can be planned at fixed periods (time-based PM) or in response to a signal provided from a machine’s captor after anomaly detection (condition-based PM). Maintenance activities’ planning depends on different constraints like human resources, spare parts availability and past operating duration of the machine.Proposed related works evaluate possible arrangements of both production and maintenance activities according to different criteria (makespan (Cmax: completion date of the last operation on the last machine), machine’s failure risk, jobs’ lateness, etc.). However, maintenance activities are frequently considered as production jobs. In fact, maintenance activities present different constraints and cannot be planned in the same …",

The latter category includes articles dealing with the psychological effects of computers on phenomena such as human development, learning, cognition, personality, and social interactions. The journal addresses human interactions with computers, not computers per se. The computer is discussed only as a medium through which human behaviors are shaped and expressed.

The aim of actual research in the cooperation and particularly the negotiation between agents is to reach a coherent global state of the multiagent system by favoring agents’ synergy. In this paper, we propose a coalition formation-based negotiation model for the task allocation in the cooperative information agent-based systems. In this model, the agent that activates a negotiation seeks partners for achieving a complex task. The way that the partners take part in a coalition is done one by one according to the choice of all the coalition members. This choice is based on a multicriterion analysis. Some obtained experimental results show the suggested model performances.",

These latter are built from spatial attributes of the tracked entities or spatial relations between them. We call these entities spatial interactors (spins). Spins can be user bodies or tangible objects manipulated by users. Spatial interaction offers intuitive interactions between users and their environment, especially within ambient smart environments. Such paradigm of user interaction finds its use in daily life where interconnected objects are in constant interaction. Many spatial applications exist but they are generally constructed based on ad hoc developments. In fact, there is a lack of generic approaches capable of supporting the process of building spatial applications, from the design phase to the deployment one. In this context, following a model-driven engineering (MDE) approach, we propose a spatial interaction modeling …",

        "Description": "Spatial user interaction refers to interactions that use spatial attributes or spatial relations between entities to trigger system functions. Spatial user interaction can offer intuitive interactions between users and their environment, particularly in ubiquitous environments where interconnected objects are in constant interaction. Many research works demonstrated the relevance of the spatial user interaction paradigm. Nevertheless, only a few were conducted to standardize the necessary concepts for designing spatial applications and to propose software tools that support spatial user interaction. The present work reviews the literature for spatial user interaction design and development. It analyses papers dealing with applications supporting spatial user interaction. It shows a lack of generic tools for designing/developing applications supporting spatial user interactions and proposes directions for future research work in this field.",

        "Description": "Spatial interactions have a great potential in ubiquitous environments. Physical objects, endowed with interconnected sensors, cooperate in a transparent manner to help users in their daily tasks. In our context, we qualify an interaction as spatial if it results from considering spatial attributes (location, orientation, speed…) of the user's body or of a given object used by her/him. According to our literature review, we found that despite their benefits (simplicity, concision, naturalness…), spatial interactions are not as widespread as other interaction models such as graphical or tactile ones. We think that this fact is due to the lack of software tools and frameworks that can make the design and development of spatial interaction easy and fast. In this paper, we propose a spatial interaction modeling language named SUIL (Spatial User Interaction Language) which represents the first step towards the development of such tools.",

This telescope'farm'will face hundreds of observation requests that have to be scheduled. The goal of this work is to compute the best schedule for all observations, over all night and using all available telescopes. The scheduler must also take into account all the interruptions that may randomly occur during the observation process, especially those relative to Gravitational Waves and Gamma-Ray Bursts alerts, which are the main goal of the Aures Observatory. To solve this multi-objectives optimization problem, we proposed a scheduler of a predictive class. A genetic algorithm approach was used to compute the solution of the scheduling problem based on NSGA-II and using Pareto Optimality.",

Agents, which may represent any entities that act in production, negotiate to find best schedules. In this paper, we present a new multi-agent scheduling method that integrates both planning and maintenance activities. Actually, more than one plan can be generated for a job production. We suppose that plan selection must depend on information about machines maintenance and states to offer realistic schedules. Tests demonstrate that despite increasing time resolution with the agents’ number, our system is scalable with reduced Cmax and machines failure risk.",

Deterministic methods are incapable of applicable solutions from the moment that they assume that the data of the problem are perfectly known and unchangeable.Les solutions proposées dans le domaine des ordonnancements conjoints de production et de maintenance considèrent les deux types d'activités (production et maintenance) de la même façon alors qu’elles n’ont pas les mêmes contraintes. En effet, la planification de la maintenance ne dépend pas seulement de l’état des machines. Elle dépend aussi de la disponibilité, de la compétence et de la performance de la ressource humaine qui va l’exécuter puisque la plupart des activités de maintenance se font manuellement. De ce fait, le temps opératoire d’une activité de maintenance ne peut être fixé que lorsque si la ressource humaine qui va l’exécuter est déterminée. Les ateliers de production sont sujets à l’apparition d’événements perturbateurs pouvant rendre les données initiales des ordonnancements obsolètes. Les méthodes déterministes sont incapables des solutions applicables à partir du moment qu’ils supposent que les données du problème sont parfaitement connues et inchangeables.",

It is applied for both production and joint production and maintenance scheduling as well. ETOMA architecture is composed of three modules: Develop, Test and Blackboard. The first one defines all agents that model the floor shop and their behavior. The second one takes care of testing the scheduling solution by using Taillard benchmarks depending on floor shop types. The considered types are Flow-shop, Job-shop and Open-shop. Finally, the Blackboard insures communication between the two predefined modules. ETOMA allows developing and testing any scheduling solution without imposing a specific architecture for agents. Moreover, ETOMA provides at the end of simulations a report composed of a recapitulative table or a curve according to user choice.",

Cette hypothèse n’est pourtant pas fidèle à la réalité des ateliers de production. Cet article présente une nouvelle approche proactive-réactive pour la résolution du problème de l’ordonnancement conjoint de la production et la maintenance sur une machine. L’approche proposée prend en compte les incertitudes des données du problème. Ces incertitudes peuvent être des imprécisions relatives aux estimations des durées opératoires des tâches ou bien des incertitudes concernant l’apparition ou non d’événements pouvant affecter le déroulement du processus de production. Pour modéliser l’imprécision, nous utilisons la logique floue et pour traiter les différents événements nous utilisons l’approche par scénarios. La méthode proposée consiste en deux phases : (1) une phase proactive dans laquelle un ordonnancement sous incertitudes de base est généré   (2) une phase réactive pour la prise en compte des événements temps réels en vue d’adapter l’ordonnancement de base aux nouvelles données. Nous utilisons la technologie agent comme support de modélisation de l'atelier de production\"",

The proposed system introduces a dialogue between two communities of agents (production and maintenance) leading to a high level of cooperation. It also provides a framework in order to react to the disturbances occurring in the workshop. This aspect is mainly concerned by corrective maintenance activities (machine breakdowns). The proposed multi-agent system is based on the integrated strategy which consists of a simultaneous scheduling of both production and preventive maintenance activities. The objective is then to optimize an objective function which takes into account both maintenance and production criterion. The main point is to show how the proposed multi-agent system is used to generate a joint production and …",

        "Description": "Gliomas are the most common primary brain malignancies, with different degrees of aggressiveness, variable prognosis and various heterogeneous histologic sub-regions, i.e., peritumoral edematous/invaded tissue, necrotic core, active and non-enhancing core. This intrinsic heterogeneity is also portrayed in their radio-phenotype, as their sub-regions are depicted by varying intensity profiles disseminated across multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) scans, reflecting varying biological properties. Their heterogeneous shape, extent, and location are some of the factors that make these tumors difficult to resect, and in some cases inoperable. The amount of resected tumor is a factor also considered in longitudinal scans, when evaluating the apparent tumor for potential diagnosis of progression. Furthermore, there is mounting evidence that accurate segmentation of the various tumor sub-regions can offer the basis for quantitative image analysis towards prediction of patient overall survival. This study assesses the state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) methods used for brain tumor image analysis in mpMRI scans, during the last seven instances of the International Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge, i.e., 2012-2018. Specifically, we focus on i) evaluating segmentations of the various glioma sub-regions in pre-operative mpMRI scans, ii) assessing potential tumor progression by virtue of longitudinal growth of tumor sub-regions, beyond use of the RECIST/RANO criteria, and iii) predicting the overall survival from pre-operative mpMRI scans of patients that underwent gross total resection. Finally, we investigate the …",

This paper presents a fully automated and efficient brain tumor segmentation method based on 2D Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DNNs) which automatically extracts the whole tumor and intra-tumor regions, including enhancing tumor, edema and necrosis, from pre-operative multimodal 3D-MRI. The network architecture was inspired by U-net and has been modified to increase brain tumor segmentation performance. Among applied modifications, Weighted Cross Entropy (WCE) and Generalized Dice Loss (GDL) were employed as a loss function to address the class imbalance problem in the brain tumor data. The proposed segmentation system has been tested and evaluated on both, BraTS …",

        "Description": "This study presents a new fully automated, fast, and accurate brain tumour segmentation method which automatically detects and extracts whole tumours from 3D‐MRI. The proposed method is based on a hybrid approach that relies on a brain symmetry analysis method and a combining region‐based and boundary‐based segmentation methods. The segmentation process consists of three main stages. In the first one, image pre‐processing is applied to remove any noise, and to extract the brain from the head image. In the second stage, automated tumour detection is performed. It is based essentially on FBB method using brain symmetry. The obtained result constitutes the automatic initialisation of a deformable model, thus removing the need of selecting the initial region of interest by the user. Finally, the third stage focuses on the application of region growing combined with 3D deformable model based on …",

It is based on a reference 3D image from which skull and skin are extracted, and an image of the skull of the unknown head for which the skin should be reconstructed. The facial reconstruction is obtained by deforming the 3D image of the reference skull to the one of the unknown skull. This transformation is based on a non‐linear registration method guided by B‐splines Free‐Form Deformations (FFD). Then, the same deformation is applied to transform the reference skin to obtain a new skin that we consider near the unknown skin. This method has been evaluated on sets of skull/skin data, extracted from 3D‐MRI of individual heads having similar anthropological features.",

        "Description": "Facial reconstruction from a cranial skeleton is an important technique in several scientific areas, especially in forensic sciences, archaeology, and palaeontology. It is used for skull identification and recognition of people. It can be classified, among reconstructive identification methods. It is most often used as a last resort, when all other techniques fail to produce a person presumed identity. This thesis addresses the facial reconstruction problem from three-dimensional (3D) images of human skulls, considered as unknown. We present a 3D computerized facial reconstruction method based on recent techniques of medical imaging, where the main objectives are the processing speed and the elimination of the subjectivity by leaning particularly on mathematical criteria for evaluating the results. Our method is based on a model deformable approach constrained by the knowledge of soft tissues thicknesses, at a certain number of characteristic landmarks. It uses, for each facial reconstruction, a 3D image of a reference head from which skull and skin are extracted, and a 3D image of the skull of the unknown head for which the skin should be reconstructed. The facial reconstruction process is divided into two main stages. An initialization step of the deformable model, based on a non-linear registration technique guided by B-Spline Free-Form Deformations (FFD) model. We therefore, propose an automatic initialization that is achieved only from a reference skull and skin set as well as an unknown skull. At first, a transformation of the reference skull image into the unknown skull image is computed. Then, we apply the same transformation to deform the …",

Cet article présente une méthode de reconstruction faciale fondée sur des techniques récentes d’imagerie médicale. La reconstruction faciale est obtenue en déformant l’image 3D du crâne de référence vers celle du crâne qualifié d’inconnu. Cette transformation s’ appuie sur un recalage 3D non linéaire guidé par un modèle de déformations de forme libre (FFD) à base de B-splines. Ensuite, la même déformation est appliquée pour transformer la peau de référence vers une nouvelle peau que nous considérons proche de la peau inconnue. Cette méthode a été évaluée à partir de deux ensembles de données crâne/peau correspondant à une tête de référence et à une tête dont la peau est à reconstruire issus d’IRM-3D de têtes d’individus ayant des caractéristiques anthropologiques similaires.Facial reconstruction from a cranial skeleton has emerged as an increasingly important tool in archaeology as well in forensic sciences for identification of people.

        "Description": "Support vector machines (SVMs) are a popular class of supervised learning algorithms, and are particularly applicable to large and high-dimensional classification problems. Like most machine learning methods for data classification and information retrieval, they require manually labeled data samples in the training stage. However, manual labeling is a time consuming and errorprone task. One possible solution to this issue is to exploit the large number of unlabeled samples that are easily accessible via the internet. This paper presents a novel active learning method for text categorization. The main objective of active learning is to reduce the labeling effort, without compromising the accuracy of classification, by intelligently selecting which samples should be labeled. The proposed method selects a batch of informative samples using the posterior probabilities provided by a set of multi-class SVM …",

The numerous constraints imposed by the environment and/or the underlying target architecture of mixed systems (containing hardware and software parts) make these two problems hard to solve. This paper introduces an automatic approach that integrates simultaneously partitioning and scheduling. It is inspired by the collective behavior of social insects such as bees in order to find a feasible solution to partitioning, using scheduling to find the shortest execution time to the system under design.",

Finding the best solutions that reduce energy consumption while ensuring the required security services is not an easy task. Many works proposed in the literature address security overhead issues by tackling some aspects such as cryptographic primitives, deployment environments, target applications, etc.This paper is a survey on energy-efficient mechanisms used in IoT security services. By studying the techniques that allow developing energy-efficient security solutions, it goes further than the previous surveys which focus more on the energy-efficient solutions themselves. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that tackles IoT security from this perspective. Not only security issues are addressed in this survey, but the energy impact of the solutions are also discussed. Energy consumption related to security services is first …",

These techniques refer to three complementary abstraction levels: algorithms, circuits, and layout. The authors deal with pseudo-random testing and present a method of condensing test points based on the notion of fault sector. Based on a set of proposed heuristics, a tool for automatically inserting test points was developed. Experimental results obtained with the tool are presented to indicate that excellent pseudo-random testability can be achieved with few test points. This technique leads to the lowest reported number of test points while significantly reducing the number of random patterns which are required to achieve very close to 100% fault coverage.<>",

However, communication performance is strongly related to the routing algorithm that is used in the NoC. The most important issues in the routing process are: deadlock, livelock, congestion and faults. In this paper, a classification of NoC routing protocols is proposed according to the problems they address. Two main families emerge: mono objective and multi objectives. A discussion of the advantages and the drawbacks of each protocols family is given. A summary of the most used practices in this field and the less used ones is provided. This survey shows that it is hard to satisfy the four objectives at the same time with classical methods, highlighting the strengths of multi-objectives approaches.",

The deployment of static security services will consume the energy even if it is not required in some situations, so this induces a waste of resources. In this paper, we introduce an efficient model for adaptive security in the IoT based on trust management. Most of existing adaptive security approaches lack of practical means to evaluate threats. On the other hand, trust management systems are designed to deal with selfish behaviors or internal attacks and not to assist cryptographic measures. Our solution evaluates the trust level related to the presence of security threats among nodes, and adapt consequently cryptographic measures. The obtained simulation results show that our solution reduces considerably energy consumption and remains yet secure.",

We consider in this paper the Shortest Path routing Tree (SPT) problem in WSN under different metrics; we show that the basic SPT based strategies are unsuitable for the many-to-one WSN when considering some metrics to compute link costs. Indeed, existing SPT approaches aim to construct a tree rooted at the sink such that the cost of the path from any node to the sink is minimal, while the cost of a given path is computed as summation of the costs of links that compose this path. However, in many-to-one WSN, links which are close to the sink are more critical than other links when using some metrics. We propose in this paper a new weighted path cost function, and we show that our cost function is more suitable for WSN. Based on this cost function, we propose a simple and efficient weighted shortest path tree construction …",

Several techniques have been proposed in the literature to deal with different types of faults at different levels of a NoC. This paper surveys the work performed on fault-tolerant mapping techniques in NoCs. A classification is proposed, based on the approaches adopted to recover from failures. Techniques based on the combination of mapping and routing, techniques based on redundancy, and techniques based on task remapping are the main categories of the classification proposed. Furthermore, performance comparison among the listed techniques is provided to highlight the differences. A discussion of the proposed techniques is also performed for each category, leading to some open issues.",

Solutions proposed in the recent literature target these objectives, but tackle them from either client or server side separately. This paper argues the use of a client-server cooperation-based approach to achieve the three objectives. Effectively, information available at the client side, such as buffer occupancy, available throughput, and previous played representation levels, can be used to better control the video streaming efficiency and stability at the client side. On the other hand, information available at the server side, such as the server's shared bandwidth capacity, and the number of connected clients and their corresponding downloading bitrates, can be leveraged to better tune the system fairness at the server side. Furthermore, the envisioned client-server cooperation aims …",

The authors consider the upcoming generation of mobile networks, 5G, as a communication architecture for the IoT. The concept of adaptive security is adopted, which is based on adjusting the security level as per the changing context. It has the potential of reducing energy consumption by adapting security rather than always considering the worst case, which is energy consuming. The consideration of 5G introduces new dynamics that can be exploited to perform more adaptation. The proposed solution introduces an intelligence in the application of security, from the establishment phase to the use phase (end-to-end). The security level related to the used cryptographic algorithm/key is adapted for each node during the establishment phase, so to match with the duration of the provided services. A new …",

CoAP/RPL/6LoWPAN has been considered as one of the most appropriate protocol stack for industrial applications of the Internet of Things (IoT). Since IoT nodes may have constrained resources, mechanisms used to control congestion must operate effectively with minimal consumption. In this paper, a method for congestion control in an IoT environment governed by the CoAP/RPL/6LoWPAN protocol stack is proposed. Our solution is based on the concept of bird flocking to guide packets in order to avoid congestion. Simulation shows that our proposal guarantees better results compared to congestion control mechanisms of the protocol stack in terms of data latency, packet loss ratio and packet delivery ratio.",

In this paper, we introduce Adaptive and dual Data-Communication Trust scheme (ADCT) for clustered wireless sensor networks to effectively deal with untrustworthy nodes. Unlike prior works, we propose an adaptive trust function to assess the direct trust between nodes according to the application’s requirement in terms of trust severity. We also consider data trust to cope with untrustworthy nodes during the data collection despite their communication capabilities.

However, such tools are confronted to a particular problem: the great number of characteristics that qualify data samples. They are more or less victims of the abundance of information. Sat domain benefits from the appearance of powerful solvers that can process huge amounts of data in short times. This paper proposes to solve supervised learning problems expressed as Sat ones. This is done to take advantage of an existing environment that allows experimenting different heuristics, such as: tabu search, genetic algorithm, ant colonies, etc., in order to extract solutions that satisfy a maximum number of clauses (Max-Sat problem). Finally, the best solutions are back-translated into rules that are applied to the data sets in order to verify that they really satisfy a …",

This extraction is affected by several factors including the device used and the acquisition conditions. The acquisition mode can alter some image properties like rotation, translation and scale. Some devices are designed to maintain hand in a fixed position and delimit a subspace of the hand. On the other hand, contactless devices offer more convenience and flexibility but lead to altered images. ROI extraction methods must consider the acquisition device (with contact or contactless). In this paper, we propose a ROI extraction method that addresses this issue. We test our method on two databases PolyU and CASIA which illustrate the impact of using contactless device unlike the PolyU device. Then, we test performances of the palmprint biometric system.

Thus, the cost of manual annotating the data will be less, and the process of learning can be accelerated. Most of the studies on applying active learning methods to automatic text classification focused on requesting the label of a single unlabeled document in each iteration. Unlike English, There are very few researches done in this area for the Arabic text. In this paper, we present a novel active learning method for Arabic text classification using multi-class SVM. The proposed method selects a batch of informative samples for manually labeling by an expert. The experimental results show that employing our method can significantly reduce the need for labeled training data.",

The first approach is a pure software implementation utilizing the MicroBlaze processor. The second involves a combination of software and hardware, with key operations in  and  being transformed into IP cores for the MicroBlaze. The third approach builds on the second by incorporating parallelism to improve the pairing process.

C'est la raison pour laquelle le besoin s' est fait sentir de développer un environnement permettant aux utilisateurs d'introduire n'importe quelle méthode ou d'en combiner plusieurs et de les étudier en profondeur. Cet article présente un environnement nommé PARME, basé sur une architecture parallèle, permettant d'implanter différentes approches pour résoudre le problème Max-Sat. Il offre à l'utilisateur un moyen efficace pour étudier les méthode de résolution des problèmes NB-Complets. L'utilisateur peut pratiquer de manière empirique différentes approches d'optimisation (Recherche Tabou, Algorithmes Génétiques, GSAT,...), évaluer leurs performances et étudier l'importance et l'influence des paramètres de la méthode sur son comportement. Afin de bénéficier des avantages des qualités de chaque méthode et de surmonter ses inconvénients, de nombreuses méthodes peuvent collaborer dans PARME, à la recherche de la solution du problème.",

Some studies build on the considerable advances already made in caries prevention, e.g. through fluoride application. Some aim to improve understanding of the increasingly important problem of dental erosion and the associated tooth wear process. Others monitor the changing pattern of caries in different populations, explore improved methods of diagnosis or evaluate methods of prevention or treatment. Studies using genetic methods to identify human genes or mutations associated with caries prevalence are welcome as are manuscripts using modern high-throughput sequencing methods to characterise microbial biofilms associated with oral health and active caries. The broad coverage of innovative research into dental caries is unique and has given the journal an outstanding international reputation as an indispensable source for both basic scientists and clinicians engaged in understanding, investigating and preventing dental diseases.",

They communicate using Web standards and protocols. Interactions are complex because numerous heterogeneous objects interact together in open environments. It is interesting to consider a WoT subsystem as a single entity. The interaction between entities of two different WoT subsystems can then be treated as a one-to-one interaction.

In such networks, nodes can be subject to frequent failures due to energy depletion and the hostile deployment environment. Our work focuses on local crash process detection in WSN considering intermittent failures due to lossy radio links. As a part of this problem, we introduce a new type of Adaptive Neighborhood Failure Detection mechanism (ANFD) that relies on adaptive timers. Then we analyze properties of the introduced failure detection algorithm and determine how and when timers' update is necessary. We carried out intensive simulations using TinyOS-2 and evaluated the performance of our solution. Simulation results show that our solution improves failure detection rate and delay, and reduces fault positive detections and packet loss ratio. Moreover, we analyzed energy consumption using PowerTossimZ and results …",

Unlike prior works, we propose an adaptive function to evaluate the direct trust between nodes according to the need of the application in terms of trust severity. We also consider data trust to cope with untrustworthy nodes during the data collection despite their communication capabilities. Finally, we introduce a new method to discard a malicious recommendation when building feedback at the base station or cluster-head level. Theoretical analysis shows that our trust mechanism allows a good trade-off between memory requirement and trust cooperation.",

The focus will be on energy depletion and lossy links. We then propose a new general FD model tailored to WSN constraints, called Adaptive Neighborhood Failure Detector for Low-power lossy WSN (AFDEL). AFDEL provides adaptive local failure detection robust against packet loss (intermittent failures) and saves the use of energy, bandwidth and memory storage. Furthermore, we introduce in AFDEL model an adaptive timer strategy. This strategy offers the possibility to customize the dynamic timer pattern with respect to application requirements in terms of completeness and accuracy. We illustrate the use of this strategy by proposing three failure detection techniques based on AFDEL general model. As a part of this work, we give a stochastic …",

This platform is independent from the physical architecture of nodes, where each node is considered as an autonomous agent having its own properties and behaviors according to the role it takes in the network. Once the description of the WSN is done using agent models, we can translate them to the simulation environment or directly to the physical network architecture using a translation library witch makes the correspondence between agent models and the target environment. To validate our work, we have extended OMNeT++ with new models for WSN and implemented some functions that translate automatically the agent models of the WSN nodes to OMNeT++ source code.",

Tt is an NP-Complete problem that deals with the different constraints relative to the system and the underlying target architecture. The reported partitioning approaches have several drawbacks (they are often dedicated to a particular application or target architecture, they operate at a unique granularity level, most of them are manual and impossible to apply for complex systems, the number of constraints they deal with is generally limited...). This paper introduces an automatic approach using genetic algorithms to solve partitioning in codesign. This approach is totally independent of target architecture. Another advantage of this approach is that it allows determining dynamically the granularity of the objects to partition, making it possible to browse more efficiently solution …",

This is due to their potential in enabling innovative services and delivering unparalleled performance. To meet these expectations, mobile network operators (MNOs) are investing in cloud native technologies to enhance the reliability, delivery, and adaptability of their services. Consequently, network infrastructures are growing in complexity, particularly with regard to the integration of computing, caching, and communications resources. Managing such complex infrastructure requires novel paradigms that can lower operational costs and enable autonomous management. One promising paradigm for achieving such goals is intent-based networking (IBN). By introducing the notion of intent, IBN empowers systems to autonomously fulfill high-level specified expectations.

Our fusion function is constructed using an evolutionary GA on the XM2VTS score database. The best one is tested on a sub-sequence of the BioSecure Score database. As this database offers quality measurement, we transform our function into a weighted function with user-specific approach to study performance enhancement with quality integration. The results are significantly improved with a high confidence and quality measurement becomes inherent to reduce recognition errors. ",

It then goes beyond teams interoperability problem. This paper presents the foundations of a model for the cooperation between existing multiagent teams. This cooperation requires nondisruption of teams' initial functioning as main principle for the model. This constraint led us to introduce the concept of virtual probes which cooperate to understand the collective products and to influence them through distributed virtual sensors and effectors on existing multiagent teams. The paper presents an illustration of the model implementation on cyber-physical multiagent teams.",

The main limit of these systems is the lack of information in terms of quantity (number of discriminant features) and quality (diversity of information, correlation…). Using multiple sources of information and/or treatment is a solution to overcome these problems and enhance system performances. Performance requirements of current systems related to context use involve designed solutions that optimally satisfy security requirements. This can represent an optimization problem that aims at searching the optimal solution matching security needs. In our study, we are interested in combining different score level rules using an evolutionary algorithm. We use Genetic Algorithm to derive a score fusion function based on primitive operations. The process uses an optimized tree to determine function …",

The purpose of this work is to show the implementation to be chosen at each stage of a specific Fuzzy Vault application. To this end, in this paper, we conduct a comparative study of these works from a theoretical point of view, and according to some practical criteria.",

This paper proposes a new fully adaptive routing protocol for 2D-mesh NoC. It is inspired from the A-star search algorithm and called HRA (Heuristic based Routing Algorithm). The latter is distributed, congestion-aware and fault-tolerant by using only the local information of each router neighbors. HRA does not use VCs (Virtual Channels) but tries to reduce the risk of deadlock by avoiding the 2-nodes and the 4-nodes loops. Results show that HRA ensures a good reliability rate despite of the presence of many faulty links. In addition, it has interesting latencies values in different NoC sizes.",

Our exploration method aims to optimize simultaneously two objectives, namely area on the FPGA and execution time, taking advantage of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) diversification ability and the intensification provided by Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) algorithm.

However, such tools are confronted to a particular problem: the great number of characteristics that qualify data samples. They are more or less victims of the abundance of information.Sat domain benefits from the appearance of powerful solvers that can process huge amounts of data in short times. This paper presents an approach for translating timetable problems (which are a particular case of DSS), into a Boolean formula, which is then provided to an environment that allows experimenting different heuristics in order to extract solutions that satisfy a maximum number of clauses (Max-Sat problem). Finally, the best solutions are back-translated into the original problem in order to find an adequate schedule that satisfies the characteristics and constraints of the timetable problem.",

        "Description": "Partitioning has a big impact on cost/performance characteristics of the system under design. It is an NP-Complete problem that deals with the different constraints relative to the system and the underlying target architecture. The existing partitioning approaches have a major drawback: they are generally dedicated to particular classes of applications and/or target architectures and this makes them difficult to generalize as soon as small changes are performed on the system under design. Besides, it is generally difficult to include new strategies that might be better suited to the applications to partition. This paper introduces a parallel environment that offers the user the opportunity to describe, experiment new heuristics and test different sets of parameters. It is also possible to explore new hybridization schemes between different strategies.",

        "Description": "Recently, palmprint recognition in forensic domain has gained considerable attention since 30 % of evidence left in crime scene originate from palms. Like most of recognition systems, palmprint one is composed of three steps: preprocessing, features extraction and representation and finally features matching. Minutiae are the most reliable and discriminating features used in these systems. Minutiae matching is then very critical. Quantifying the similarity between two sets of extracted minutiae and assigning a score is particularly important in this step. In this paper, we designed similarity scores for a minutiae based recognition system using a minimum of extracted information. Our proposed scores are based on the score of [1], used in point pattern matching. They are tested and compared on the database used in [2]. The best one is tested and compared to the one presented in the same work [2]. Obtained results …",

In this paper, we focus on the use of mobile WSN to generate high spatio-temporal resolution air quality maps. We address the sensors' online redeployment problem and we propose three redeployment models allowing to assess, with high precision, the air pollution concentrations. Unlike most of existing movement assisted deployment strategies based on network generic characteristics such as coverage and connectivity, our approaches take into account air pollution properties and dispersion models to offer an efficient air quality estimation. First, we introduce our proposition of an optimal integer linear program based on air pollution dispersion characteristics to minimize estimation errors. Then, we propose a local iterative integer linear programming model and a heuristic …",

The authors analyse fusion efficiency of a significant number of multi‐biometric fusion schemes. To do so, the study applies different functions that are generated using genetic programming (GP) on the 2000 multi‐biometric instances produced by the fusion of different biometric matching scores. The functions are represented using a tree of arithmetic operations and are used for fusion at score level. First, genetic programming is implemented on the XM2VTS score database. The GP optimizes the half total error rate of fused matching scores. Then, a comparative study is performed based on our experiments on matching scores of different biometric baseline systems provided by the bio‐secure database. This database provides 24 streams that we use to generate 2000 multi‐biometric combinations. These multi‐biometric …",

Chaff-points generation process consists of creating a set of chaff points similar to authentic minutiae feature representation. Squares based chaff-points generation consist of delimiting a square boundary around each chaff-point in such a way that a square must never overlap with other squares. Unlike the typical squares method where chaff-points and their boundaries are generated sequentially, in our proposal, the referred chaff-points are generated all together then the knapsack problem formulation is used along with 0/1 dynamic programing resolution to determine if each chaff-point respects the constraints. The experiments results show that the chaff-points generation based on Knapsack method generates the referred number of chaff-points …",

In real application scenarios, the collection of training (labeled) samples to design a classifier is not always trivial due to the complexity and the cost which characterize the process. A possible solution to this issue can be found in the exploitation of the large number of unlabeled samples which are accessible at zero cost from the web. Active learning strives to reduce the required labeling effort while retaining the accuracy by intelligently selecting the samples to be labeled. This Study presents a novel active learning method for text classification that selects a batch of informative samples for manual labeling by an expert. The proposed method uses the posterior probability output of a multi-class SVM method. The experiments are performed with two well-known datasets and the presented …",

        "Description": "Palmprint is one of the modalities that offer high recognition accuracy. The recognition process depends on an optimized ROI (Region of Interest) extraction. This extraction is affected by several factors including the device used and the acquisition conditions. The acquisition step can alter some image properties like rotation, translation and scale. Some devices are designed to maintain hand in a fixed position and delimit a subspace of the hand. On the other hand, contactless devices offer more convenience and flexibility but lead to altered images. ROI extraction methods must consider the acquisition device (with contact or contactless). In this paper, we propose palmprint recognition system considering this issue. A ROI extraction method is implemented and tested on different databases taking into account the acquisition device with different sensor conditions. Our research to test this method, are conducted on …",

Most of current implementations of unreliable failure detectors (FD) use mechanisms to notify process failures in fully connected networks with reliable communication links. This assumption is not applicable to lossy networks. Furthermore, such implementations do not consider resource limitations in terms of energy, storage and bandwidth. This paper presents a new failure detection model for Low-power Lossy Networks (LLN). Our approach defines an adaptive timer-based paradigm. Besides, we introduce two techniques based on the proposed general model. We evaluate all contributions using implementation on Omnet++/Mixim framework. Simulation results demonstrate that our FD enhances detection performances for LLN compared to traditional FD.",

        "Description": "The central focus of this work is the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), a machine learning model widely used for density estimation and cluster analysis. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is commonly used to train GMMs. One of the main challenges facing this algorithm under the shift towards embedded systems is the crippling memory constraints. Indeed, the EM is an iterative algorithm that requires several scans of the data, thus several I/O opeartions. Hence, when the dataset cannot be fully stored in the main memory, its execution is slowed down by the huge data movements (I/Os) between the main memory and the secondary storage. In this work, we present an I/O optimization of the EM algorithm for GMMs that relies on two main contributions: (1) a divide-and-conquer strategy that divides the dataset into chunks, learns the GMM separately in each chunk and combines the results incrementally; (2) a strategy that restricts the training of the GMM on a subset of data while producing a sufficiently good accuracy, by utilizing the information learned from the first chunk.",

The first approach is a fully software implementation using MicroBlaze processor. The second approach is software/hardware implementation, in which the most useful operations in\\({\\varvec {F}} _ {\\varvec {p}}\\) and\\({\\varvec {F}} _ {{\\varvec {p}}^{2}}\\) are coded as intellectual property cores around the Microblaze. The third approach is based on the second in which we exploit the parallelism that exists to compute Optimal Ate pairing. The integration of multi-MicroBlaze processor in single architecture allows not only the flexibility of the overall system but also the parallelism to speed up pairing. Various techniques and parameters are used and combined to compute Optimal Ate in efficient way, namely: Montgomery modular multiplication, Karatsuba method, Jacobean coordinate, Complex method for squaring, Sparse multiplication, squaring in the cyclotomic subgroup\\({\\varvec {G}} _ {\\varvec {\\varphi} 6}\\left ({\\varvec {F}} _ {{\\varvec {p}}^{12}}\\right)\\) and addition chain method.

        "Description": "A cyber-physical system (CPS) is a system with integrated computational and physical abilities. Deriving the notion of cyber-physical collective (CPC) from a social view of CPS, we consider the nodes of a CPS as individuals (agents) that interact to overcome their limits in the collective. When CPC agents are able to move in their environment, the CPC is considered as a Mobile CPC (MCPC). The interactions of the agents give rise to the appearance of a phenomenon collectively generated by the agents of the CPC that we call a collective product. This phenomenon is not recorded as “a whole” in the CPC because an agent has only a partial view of its environment. This paper presents COPE (COllective Product Exploitation), an approach that allows one MCPC to exploit the collective product of another one. The approach is based on the deployment of meta-agents in both systems. A meta-agent is an agent that is external to a MCPC but is associated with one of its agents. Each meta-agent is able to monitor the agent with which it is associated and can fake its perceptions to influence its behavior. The meta-agents deployed in the system from which the collective product emerges provide indicators related to this product. Utilizing these indicators, the meta-agents deployed in the other system can act on the agents in order to adapt the global dynamics of the whole system. The proposed coupling approach is evaluated in a “fire detection and control” use case. It allows a system of UAVs to use the collective product of a network of sensors to monitor the fire.",

        "Description": "Network on chip (NoC) design gained a lot of attention in recent years, this is due to the performance provided by this new System-on-Chip (SoC) interconnect paradigm. Several research issues related to N oC design are addressed. Therefore, developing simulators and tools for evaluating NoC performance, has become of paramount importance. Reliability, is one of the most important and critical features that must be considered by network on chip designers in the early stages of design. In this paper, we present a new platform named FTNoCSim, based on OMNeT++ framework. Its architecture is designed to make easier the implementation and the evaluation of innovative fault tolerance techniques for three layers of the NoC OSI model: data link, network and transport layers. FTNoCSim users can explore basic concepts of NoC or assess their designs in terms of reliability, latency and power consumption. The …",

        "Description": "Les accélérateurs matériels ont été depuis longtemps utilisés pour booster les performances dans les MPSoC. Cependant, ces derniers introduisent un surplus d’occupation de surface sur ces systèmes. Le travail présenté dans cet article présente un outil pour trouver un compromis entre l’accélération apportée par ces accélérateurs matériels et la surface occupée par ces derniers. Pour ce faire, nous proposons d’utiliser un nouveau type d’architectures basé sur le partage d’accélérateurs matériels. Nous présentons une approche d’exploration de l’espace de conception (ou DSE pour Design Space Exploration) basée sur un algorithme génétique hybridé à un nouveau type de recherche locale (PVNS), pour l’exploration bi-objectif de l’espace de conception, dans les architectures à base de partage d’accélérateurs matériels. L’approche proposée a été testée sur trois applications: le Multiple Target Tracking (MTT), le JPEG et une application synthétique. Notre algorithme apporte un gain en temps d’exploration pouvant atteindre les 99.86% par rapport aux travaux existants basés sur un modèle mixte de programmation linéaire en nombres entiers (MILP), tout en y ajoutant la considération de la contrainte d’accélération. Cette approche permet une réduction de la surface occupée par les accélérateurs pouvant atteindre les 81, 48%, par rapport à une implémentation sans partage d’accélérateurs.",

Dans CODOO, un système est spécifié en utilisant le langage C étendu par une librairie temps réel pour pouvoir exprimer les contraintes temporelles. Une fois le système spécifié, un partitionnement interactif est effectué permettant de distinguer les trois parties du système: le hardware (les ASICs), le software (le programme) et l interface entre les deux. Le processus de partitionnement commence par la construction du graphe de communication inters objets. Ce dernier est ensuite affiché à l écran pour permettre au concepteur de sélectionner les objets à implémenter en hardware. Le choix du concepteur est guidé par un certain nombre d informations de synthèse fournies par le graphe comme le taux de communication, la taille des objets, etc. Une fois le partitionnement effectué, le code C de la …",

The need for a multiprocessor system is justified and various methods of inter-processor communication are explored. Solutions are also given for the problems associated with the division of the modelling task amongst the processors in the system. Finally the design of a system which has been used to model the human vocal tract in real time will be described.",

There are several methods to perform segmentation. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) constitutes an elegant way to model the problem of segmentation. This modelling leads to the minimization of an energy function. In this paper we focus on Particles Swarm Optimization (PSO) method to solve this optimization problem. The quality of segmentation is evaluated on grounds truths images using the Kappa index. The results show the supremacy of the HMRF-PSO method compared to K-means and threshold based techniques.",

In particular image mosaicing is used to assemble several overlapping images in order to constitute the global frame. We will focus on a feature-point matching method to perform the mosaicing. The SIFT algorithm is used to extract the feature points in both images. The mosaicing result is obtained after transforming the sensed or target image to align to the reference image. Performing a mosaicing operation is not sufficient to claim reaching the goal. Objective metrics must be used to evaluate the resulting mosaic. In this paper we present a complete mosaicing system named EsiReg and give a brief comparative insight on results of stitching satellite and aerial images using well known performance metrics.",

Medical image segmentation is thus an important process in image processing used to partition the images into different regions (eg gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)). Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) Model and Gibbs distributions provide powerful tools for image modeling. In this paper, we use a HMRF model to perform segmentation of volumetric medical images. We have a problem with incomplete data. We seek the segmented images according to the MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) criterion. MAP estimation leads to the minimization of an energy function. This problem is computationally intractable. Therefore, optimizations techniques are used to compute a solution. We will evaluate the segmentation upon two major factors: the time of calculation and the quality of segmentation. Processing time is reduced by distributing the computation of segmentation on a powerful and inexpensive architecture that consists of a cluster of personal computers. Parallel programming was done by using the standard MPI (Message Passing Interface).",

With the huge number of medical images, the manual analysis and interpretation became a tedious task. Thus, automatic image segmentation became essential for diagnosis assistance. Segmentation consists in dividing the image into homogeneous and significant regions. We focus on hidden Markov random fields referred to as HMRF to model the problem of segmentation. This modelisation leads to a classical function minimisation problem. Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm referred to as BFGS is one of the most powerful methods to solve unconstrained optimisation problem. In this paper, we investigate the combination of HMRF and BFGS algorithm to perform the segmentation operation.

We will present a CBIR system named YACBIR (Yet Another CBIR) that combines several properties (color, texture and points of interest) extracted automatically to index and retrieve images.",

We conduct a study for the choice of parameters that give a good segmentation. The quality of segmentation is evaluated on grounds truths images using Misclassification Error criterion.

In the field of medical imaging, registration is used to match anatomic structures from two or more images taken at different times to track for example the evolution of a disease. Intensity based techniques are widely used in multimodal registration. To have the best matching, a cost function expressing the similarity between these images is maximized. To resolve this problem, we evaluate two global optimization techniques that are genetic algorithms and simulated annealing. In this paper we show some results obtained in medical images registration.",

Medical image segmentation is thus an important process in image processing used to partition the images into different regions (eg gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid). Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) Model and Gibbs distributions provide powerful tools for image modeling. In this paper, we use a HMRF model to perform segmentation of volumetric medical images. We have a problem with incomplete data. We seek the segmented images according to the MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) criterion. MAP estimation leads to the minimization of an energy function. This problem is computationally intractable. Therefore, optimizations techniques are used to compute a solution. We will evaluate the segmentation upon two major factors: the time of calculation and the quality of segmentation. Processing time is reduced by distributing the computation of segmentation on a powerful and inexpensive architecture that consists of a cluster of personal computers. Parallel programming was done by using the standard MPI (Message Passing Interface).",

Segmentation is one of key operations to provide a decision support to physicians. There are several methods to perform segmentation. We use Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) for modelling the segmentation problem. This elegant model leads to an optimization problem. Particles Swarm Optimization (PSO) method is used to achieve brain magnetic resonance image segmentation. Setting the parameters of the HMRF-PSO method is a task in itself. We conduct a study for the choice of parameters that give a good segmentation. The segmentation quality is evaluated on ground-truth images, using the Dice coefficient also called Kappa index. The results show a superiority of the HMRF-PSO method, compared to methods such as Classical MRF and MRF using variants of ACO (Ant Colony Optimization).",

That segments the brain images into different tissue types (Grey Matter, White Matter, and Cerebro Spinal Fluid) in order to help physicians to determine easily the final decision. The underlying method is based on hidden Markov random fields to extract image features for using them as inputs of our neural network model. IBSR images with their ground-truth are used to train and evaluate our model. The quality of segmentation is measured by using the Dice coefficient metric. Setting the parameters of the DL-HMRF model is a task in itself. We have generated six models with different parameters to select the one that gives the best segmentation.

They provide an approximate solution, close to the optimum, for complex problems (NP-hard problems). The performance guarantees of these methods vary depending on the chosen parameter values. However, selecting parameter values that yield good performance is a challenging task. Since the 1950s, Genichi Taguchi, a Japanese engineer, has developed robust design techniques to improve the quality of manufactured goods. Recently, these techniques have found applications in various domains, including engineering and biotechnology. In this paper, we investigate the application of the Taguchi design for the first time to simplify the process of selecting suitable parameter values for Elephant Herding Optimization (EHO) variants. These later are recent and known by their simplicity and ease …",

In this paper we present a general purpose image mosaicking system, named EsiReg. We will focus on some aspects of EsiReg mainly video mosaicking and panoramic views creation. We will rely on a feature-point stitching approach to perform the registration of images. A robust algorithm is used to extract the features points in the images. To have a smooth resulting image, seamless blending methods are also implemented. Performing a mosaicking operation is not sufficient to claim reaching the goal. We have used objective metrics to evaluate the mosaic and confront the results to comparable systems.",

        "Description": "In recent years, university teaching methods have evolved and almost all higher education institutions use e-learning platforms to deliver courses and learning activities. However, these digital learning environments present significant dropout and low completion rates. This is primarily due to the lack of student motivation and engagement. Gamification which can be defined as the application of game design elements in non-game activities has been used to address the issue of learner distraction and stimulate students’ involvement in the course. However, choosing the right combination of game elements remains a challenge for gamification designers and practitioners due to the lack of proven design approaches, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach that works regardless of the gamification context. Therefore, our study focused on providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of gamification in …",

Ranking similar web services based on QoS is then an important issue. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to rank-order Skyline Web services, which mixes several methods borrowed from Multi-Criteria Decision Making field. The Skyline method is used to reduce the decision space and focusing only on interesting Web services that are not dominated by any other service. For weighting QoS criteria, we aggregate objective and subjective weights. The objective Entropy weights are extracted directly from invocation history data, however, the subjective weights are calculated using Fuzzy AHP from user opinions.

        "Description": "Gamification is known as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts. It has gained a great interest from both industrials and academics during the last years due to its role in increasing engagement of people in several sectors including business, learning, crowdsourcing and enterprise information systems. However, due to its inherent multi-disciplinarity, gamification lacks an integrated view and a holistic and consensual agreement on its foundational concepts among the stakeholders. In this context we propose OntoGamif (Ontology of Gamification), a modular ontology for the gamification domain of interest covering topics concerning, for instance, target users, organizational structures, ethical issues, and psychological factors. These are organized as seven linked modular sub-ontologies that can be used also independently to support the work of gamification designers implementing personalized …",

It gave promising results when applied to many domains. However, analysts predict that most gamification systems are doomed to failure due to the lack of understanding of the gamification design process. Many attempts tried to propose design frameworks for gamification. Nevertheless, only few works were conducted to review the literature in this area of research. The present work is an attempt to review the literature for gamification design. It analyses and compares 28 candidate papers dealing with gamification design for generic application from different digital libraries. It results in a synthesis of the existing body of knowledge and identifies gaps that need to be completed.",

CI enables the development of strategies that confer companies a significant competitive advantage. The appropriate decisions are taken when all required data are considered. As the amount of data grows very fast inside and outside of an enterprise, exploiting these mountains of data efficiently became a crucial need. Note that such data are usually multiples, heterogeneous, autonomous and distributed. The main issue is related to the identification and resolution of structural and semantic heterogeneity between data, usually spread in multiple sources. Data integration is a significant solution that addresses these problems. Data Warehouse (DW) is viewed as Data Integration System (DIS) that consolidates several data sources in the …",

In  approaches, these three types of ontologies are considered. However, these studies do not consider the types of the used ontologies which usually affect the quality of the managed data.

Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) phase plays a crucial role in designing DW. To overcome the complexity of the ETL phase, different studies have recently proposed the use of ontologies. Ontology-based ETL approaches have been used to reduce heterogeneity between data sources and ensure automation of the ETL process. Existing studies in semantic ETL have largely focused on fulfilling functional requirements. However, the ETL process quality dimension has not been sufficiently considered by these studies. As the amount of data has exploded with the advent of big data era, dealing with quality challenges in the early stages of designing the process become more important than ever.

Economic intelligence actors collaborate to solve a decisional problem, they use significant mental effort, and so they share a common knowledge that can indicate to other actors directions to follow or avoid. Indeed, whenever an actor explores knowledge or a relevant document, it enriches the collective knowledge of the memory via annotations. To ensure this collaboration in solving a decisional problem among actors in a context of economic intelligence, in this article we propose a conceptual model using ontologies to represent collaborative semantic annotations between economic intelligence actors in order to capitalise on and reuse the knowledge shared in a collective memory.",

However, it returns generally a conflicting result. The AHP (Analytical Hierarchic Processes) method and its variants as Fuzzy AHP are widely used in ranking incomparable alternatives. However, it requires a huge number of inputs for users to fulfill a multiple comparison matrix, which make it difficult to use in practice notably in Web services selection field.

        "Description": "In the big data era, data integration is becoming increasingly important. It is usually handled by data flows processes that extract, transform, and clean data from several sources, and populate the data integration system (DIS). Designing data flows is facing several challenges. In this article, we deal with data quality issues such as (1) specifying a set of quality rules, (2) enforcing them on the data flow pipeline to detect violations, and (3) producing accurate repairs for the detected violations. We propose QDflows, a system for designing quality-aware data flows that considers the following as input: (1) a high-quality knowledge base (KB) as the global schema of integration, (2) a set of data sources and a set of validated users’ requirements, (3) a set of defined mappings between data sources and the KB, and (4) a set of quality rules specified by users. QDflows uses an ontology to design the DIS schema. It offers the …",

However, such tools are confronted to a particular problem: the great number of characteristics that qualify data samples. They are more or less victims of the abundance of information.Sat domain benefits from the appearance of powerful solvers that can process huge amounts of data in short times. This paper presents an approach for translating timetable problems (which are a particular case of DSS), into a Boolean formula, which is then provided to an environment that allows experimenting different heuristics in order to extract solutions that satisfy a maximum number of clauses (Max-Sat problem). Finally, the best solutions are back-translated into the original problem in order to find an adequate schedule that satisfies the characteristics and constraints of the timetable problem.",

        "Description": "In this paper, we present CSP-DC, a data cleaning system that integrates a new intelligent solution into the cleaning process to improve data accuracy, consistency, and minimize user involvement. We address three main challenges:(1) Consistency: Most repairing algorithms introduce new violations when repairing data, especially when constraints have overlapping attributes.(2) Automaticity: User intervention is time-consuming, we seek to minimize their efforts.(3) Accuracy: Most automatic approaches compute minimal repairs and apply unverified modifications to repair ambiguous cases, which may introduce more noise. To address these challenges, we propose to formulate this problem as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) allowing updates that always maintain data consistency. To achieve high performances, we perform a first cleaning phase to automatically repair violations that are easily handled by existing repair algorithms. We handle violations with multiple possible repairs with a CSP solving algorithm, which selects from possible fixes, values that respect all constraints. To reduce the problem’s complexity, we propose a new variables ordering technique and pruning strategies, allowing to optimize the repair search and find a solution quickly. Our experiments show that CSP-DC provides consistent and accurate repairs in a linear time, while also minimizing user intervention.",

It consists of using elements borrowed from games like points, badges and leader-boards to motivate employees for using information systems and improve their performance and productivity. Gamification gave promising results when applied to different domains like education, health, crowd-sourcing and banking among others. To implement and deploy gamification systems, different architectures were proposed to structure these new systems. However, none of these architectures consider the quality of data exchanged between the different components of the architecture. In this context, we propose an architectural framework for gamification systems based on web-sockets technology to guarantee a real time communication to better follow the behavior of the user.

This usually means build, maintain and evolve an explicit representation of knowledge. The next step is to provide access to that knowledge, that is to say, the spread in order to enable effective use. Knowledge management in the medical field aims to improve the performance of the medical organization by allowing individuals in the care facility (doctors, nurses, paramedics, etc...) to capture, share and apply collective knowledge in order to make optimal decisions in real time. In this paper we propose a knowledge management approach based on integration technique of heterogeneous data in the medical field by creating a data warehouse, a technique of extracting knowledge from medical data by choosing a technique of data mining, and finally an exploitation technique of that knowledge in a case-based reasoning system.",

        "Description": "Over the years data cleaning solutions have focused on modifying data in order to satisfy a set of integrity constraints (ICs). However, constraints may also be erroneous. Consequently, when dealing with an inconsistency, it becomes difficult to determine whether the data is dirty, the ICs or both. In this paper, we address three main challenges:(1) Uncertainty: Since both data and ICs could be dirty, it is difficult to detect the source of the inconsistency and how to repair it. We propose a new metric to evaluate the relevance degree of ICs (Functional Dependencies (FDs)).(2) ICs Accuracy: when repairing ICs, they could be transformed to overrefined ICs preventing errors detection or oversimplified ICs leading to clean data modification. We propose to extract possible FD repairs from association rules with limiting the number of LHS attributes to avoid overrefined FDs. Oversimplified FDs on the other hand, are avoided by allowing FD repairs only when the candidate is close enough to the FD.(3) Data Accuracy: Most existing solutions repairing both data and constraints, focus more on the simultaneous repair and less on the data repair algorithm, which affects the quality of the data updates. We propose to use CSP-DC which updates data when possible, and handles ambiguous repair cases by formulating the data cleaning problem as a constraint satisfaction problem, allowing all repairs to be consistent. Experiments show that our solution outperforms most renowned state-of-the-art approaches and provides accurate constraints and data repairs in a linear time.",

        "Description": "Annotation has demonstrated its importance in several areas, notably in the modeling of annotation activity in the automation and adaptation phase. However, the context sensor is commonly manual or semi-automatic. The use of the Internet of Things with annotation gives a qualitative leap in the field of higher education and universities. In this field, teachers, during their pedagogical activities, require more information found in different textual documents, tools, and databases. In addition, they organized several meetings and took considerable time to make appropriate and right decisions during the deliberation process. In this paper, we propose an adaptive annotation tool based on the Internet of Things addressed for teachers during their educational tasks. The presented tool automatically adapts according to the context of the teacher’s tasks and it enables the annotation of all documents written in different …",

        "Description": "Over the years data cleaning solutions have focused on modifying data in order to satisfy a set of integrity constraints (ICs). However, constraints may also be erroneous. Consequently, when dealing with an inconsistency, it becomes difficult to determine whether the data is dirty, the ICs or both. In this paper, we address three main challenges: (1) Uncertainty: Since both data and ICs could be dirty, it is difficult to detect the source of the inconsistency and how to repair it. We propose a new metric to evaluate the relevance degree of ICs (Functional Dependencies (FDs)). (2) ICs Accuracy: when repairing ICs, they could be transformed to overrefined ICs preventing errors detection or oversimplified ICs leading to clean data modification. We propose to extract possible FD repairs from association rules with limiting the number of LHS attributes to avoid overrefined FDs. Oversimplified FDs on the other hand, are avoided …",

Its main goal is to allow decision-makers to, efficiently, access datasets in OLAP system anywhere and anytime. The challenge of this work is to be able to improve decisional performances while overcoming capability context. To achieve this goal, the framework integrates in a systematic, generic and extensible way, knowledge in the context-aware recommender process, on one hand. On the other hand, it proposes contextual recommendations. For that purpose, the context-aware recommender system exploits the knowledge extracted (profile in a particular situation ‘contextual profile’) automatically and the current user’s contextual profile to compute a list of contextual recommendations (analysis) adapted to the capability context. We conducted a set of experiments to evaluate the performance of our knowledge-based framework. The …",

        "Description": "OLAP systems facilitate analysis by providing a multidimensional data space which decision makers explore interactively by a succession of OLAP operations. However, these systems are developed for a group of decision makers or topic analysis \"subject-oriented\", which are presumed, have identical needs. It makes them unsuitable for a particular use. Personalization aims to better take into account the user; first this paper presents a summary of all work undertaken in this direction with a comparative study. Secondly we developed a search algorithm for class association rules between query type and user (s) to deduce the profile of a particular user or a user set in the same category. These will be extracted from the log data file of OLAP server. For this we use a variant of prediction and explanation algorithms. These profiles then form a knowledge base. This knowledge base will be used to generate automatically a rule base (ACE), for assigning weights to the attributes of data warehouses by type of query and user preferences. More it will deduce the best contextual sequence of requests for eventual use in a recommended system.",

        "Description": "Management by project is actually a new theory of work organisation which provides, when properly organised, tremendous improvements in both productivity and innovation [Davenport, 93]. But project management techniques and implementation have to be oriented on business results and not only on control of projects.Project control variables are now clearly defined as in [Duncan, 96]: objectives, time, costs, quality, human resources, performance, processes and risk. Another point to be taken into account is the fact that risk is a distributed and unstructured knowledge, making difficult a systematic use. The objectives of PRIMA Project (Project RIsk MAnagement-IST-1999-10193) that we will present in this paper, follow all these points. Its main characteristics are:",

This problem is of crucial importance in the field of social network analysis. The goal of our paper is to classify existing methods dealing with the issue. We propose a classification of various methods for tracking community evolution in dynamic social networks into four main approaches using as a criterion the functioning principle: the first one is based on independent successive static detection and matching; the second is based on dependent successive static detection; the third is based on simultaneous study of all stages of community evolution; finally, the fourth and last one concerns methods working directly on temporal networks. Our paper starts by giving basic concepts about social networks, community structure and strategies for evaluating community detection …",

        "Description": "This work focuses on the problem of scheduling jobs on a single machine that requires flexible maintenance under human resource competence and availability constraints. To solve the problem we developed two fuzzy genetic algorithms that are based on respectively the sequential and total scheduling strategies. The one respecting the sequential strategy consists in two phases. In the first phase, the integrated production and maintenance schedules are generated. In the second one, the human resources are assigned to maintenance activities. The second algorithm respecting a total strategy consists in generating the integrated production and maintenance schedules that explicitly satisfy the human resource constraints. In regard to these two different strategies, we studied then two integrated fuzzy genetic algorithms that use the fuzzy logic framework to deal with the uncertain nature of both production and …",

PM activities can be planned at fixed periods (time-based PM) or in response to a signal provided from a machine’s captor after anomaly detection (condition-based PM). Maintenance activities’ planning depends on different constraints like human resources, spare parts availability and past operating duration of the machine.Proposed related works evaluate possible arrangements of both production and maintenance activities according to different criteria (makespan (Cmax: completion date of the last operation on the last machine), machine’s failure risk, jobs’ lateness, etc.).

For each strategy, we present three heuristics: Genetic Algorithms (GAs), Taboo Search (TS) and NEH heuristic. The proposed heuristics have been applied to non-standard test problems, which represent joint production and maintenance benchmark flowshop scheduling problems taken from Benbouzid et al. (2003). A comparison of the solutions yielded by the heuristics developed in this paper with the heuristic solutions given by Taillard (1993) is undertaken with respect to the minimisation of performance loss after maintenance insertion. The comparison shows that the proposed integrated GAs are clearly superior to all the analysed algorithms.",

For this reason, we propose a new interpretation of PHM outputs to define machines degradations corresponding to each job. Moreover, to take into account the several sources of uncertainty in the prognosis process, we choose to model PHM outputs using fuzzy logic.

The integrated strategy is the representation of the tasks of maintenance and production. The objective is to optimize an objective function which takes into account the criteria of maintenance and production at the same time.

Besides, we explore the most predictive features for each event. Our experiments on DBLP and Facebook datasets, using community structural features and its influential members' features, confirm that the prediction of the next event that may occur to an evolving community using change rates of features can be achieved with a very high accuracy. We further observe that the most significant features vary according to each event prediction.",

The proposed algorithm, called VacGA, introduces vaccination into the field of GAs based on the theory of immunity in biology. VacGA employs a GA to perform global search and an artificial immune system to perform local search. VacGA has been tested on Taillard’s benchmarks, and compared with standard GA and the best existing hybrid GAs. The obtained results shed light on the efficiency of our new hybrid method. Furthermore, the effects of some parameters are discussed.",

The proposed system introduces a dialogue between two communities of agents (production and maintenance) leading to a high level of cooperation. It also provides a framework in order to react to the disturbances occurring in the workshop. This aspect is mainly concerned by corrective maintenance activities (machine breakdowns). The proposed multi-agent system is based on the integrated strategy which consists of a simultaneous scheduling of both production and preventive maintenance activities. The objective is then to optimize an objective function which takes into account both maintenance and production criterion. The main point is to show how the proposed multi-agent system is used to generate a joint production and …",

Our main contribution is to propose game modeling that allows decision maker to have compromise solutions meeting at best production and maintenance criteria. To achieve this, two new games formulations for the problem are proposed, and a stable solution for the players is obtained through the concept of equilibrium. The first game follows a constructive approach while the second one follows an improvement one. Moreover, to cope with the concept of game types, we proposed two player’s behaviors: rational and non-rational. Extensive experiments are carried out to validate our proposed approaches and developed methods.

Cependant l'ordonnancement de leurs activités respectives est indépendant, et ne tient pas compte de cette contrainte. Les ressources (machines) sont toujours considérées comme disponibles à tout moment ou éventuellement durant certaines fenêtres de temps. Dès lors la planification de la maintenance n'est jamais prioritaire sur la production, pour effectuer des interventions préventives. Les travaux de cette thèse proposent quelques éléments de réponse au problème de la planification commune et intégrée des tâches de maintenance et de production, avec comme objectif le respect des contraintes intrinsèques au problème. L'objectif de notre travail est double. D'une part démontrer la nécessité de développer des heuristiques d'ordonnancement conjoint production/maintenance pour atteindre l'objectif d'optimisation de la sûreté de fonctionnement du système de production. Dans ce contexte nous avons proposé l'adaptation d'un certains nombre d'heuristiques des approches constructive, itérative et évolutive pour le cas de l'ordonnancement conjoint production/maintenance dans un atelier de type flowshop de permutation. D'autre part, nous avons étudié la contribution de la maintenance à la robustesse de ces ordonnancements conjoints. Le modèle proposé a pour objectif d'inscrire la génération d'ordonnancements conjoints comme une démarche proactive, et de démontrer que l'intégration de la maintenance lors de la génération des ordonnancements de production est à mettre au profit de la robustesse de ces derniers.",

We propose a new hybrid genetic immune algorithm, called IPro-HGIA, which incorporates an emulation of GA with artificial immune system, to create an integrated prognostic based scheduling for planning both production and predictive maintenance interventions under the total interventions cost minimization criterion. Furthermore, we use the principals of vaccination and receptor editing in order to strengthen search ability. Computational results show the efficiency of our hybrid scheme.",

The proposed approach inherits its evolutionary cycle from a multi-objective immune network supplemented by a FAP-specific local search as well as clonal selection for a better intensification. Moreover, a genetic mutation is applied at each generation to enhance the exploration of the research space. Computational experiments performed over COST259 instances and based on the hypervolume metric, show the efficiency of the newly proposed hybrid algorithm, and corroborated by the comparisons we did with the most frequently referred algorithms in …",

To start with, the dynamic network is split into a series of timeframes, each one containing interactions aggregated over a time period such as a month, a day or an hour. Splitting the network into timeframes is of crucial importance to capture the right communities' temporal evolution before predicting their future. Our paper investigates the problem of choosing the appropriate scale for network splitting which would improve the prediction. The experiments we conducted on Facebook and Higgs Twitter datasets offer strong empirical evidence of the usefulness of considering the appropriate network splitting as a first step in predicting community evolution in dynamic social networks.",

The objective function involves both the tardiness and the earliness resulting from production and maintenance tasks. We propose a mathematical formulation of the studied problem that is expressed in the constraint programming (CP) paradigm as a set of linear constraints. This CP modeling had been implemented in ILOG OPL language and the exact method Cplex is applied on it to compute the optimal solutions of relatively small instances of the problem. Further, a heuristic algorithm is provided to deal with lager instances of the problem. Computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed heuristic performs well and is able to find good solutions to instances up to 700 …",

In this context, we investigate the permutation flowshop scheduling problem subjected to predictive maintenance based on prognostics and health management (PHM). To solve this problem, two integrated metaheuristics are proposed with the objective of minimising the makespan: a carefully tailored genetic algorithm (GA), and a variable neighbourhood search (VNS) incorporating well designed local search procedures. Moreover, we hybridise the two metaheuristics where the GA best solution is introduced as initial solution of VNS. The proposed metaheuristics use the fuzzy logic framework to deal with the uncertainties. To gain insight in the performance of the proposed methods, several computational experiments were conducted against Taillard's benchmarks endowed with the prognostics and …",

Our experiments on well-known Taillard’s benchmark showed the performance of tailored GAs. HHGA was able to build genetic algorithms that reached optimal solutions in 50 instances out of 120 and was at least as good as state-of-the-art approaches.

It consists of extracting and processing different failure types features to set up a knowledge base, which contains different failure types. The first phase consists in pre-processing the measured signals by aggregating them and preparing the data in exploitable formats for the clustering. The second phase ensures the induction machine operating mode diagnosis. A measured signals clustering is performed to build classes where each one represents a health state. A variable neighborhood search (VNS) metaheuristic is designed for data clustering. Moreover, VNS is hybridized with a classical mechanics-inspired optimization (CMO) metaheuristic to balance global exploration and local exploitation during the evolutionary process. The third phase consists of two-step failure detection, setting up a knowledge base containing different failure types, and defining a representative model for each failure type. In the learning step, different class features are extracted and inserted in the knowledge base to be used during the decision step. The proposed metaheuristic-based failure detection diagnosis approach is evaluated using PRONOSTIA and CWR bearing data experimental platforms vibration and temperature measurements. The achieved results clearly demonstrate the failure detection and diagnosis, efficiency, and effectiveness of the proposed metaheuristic approach.",

The objective functions are to minimize the total completion time for the production part and the total earliness/tardiness for PM part. The resolution consists of two steps: the one consists on scheduling production jobs using an artificial immune algorithm (AIA); the second one consists on deploying PM operations, taking the production schedule as a mandatory constraint of resources unavailability in the resolution of the problem. Furthermore, we use the principles of vaccination and receptor editing in order to strengthen search ability. The efficiency of the proposed AIAs with respect to minimization of makespan for the production part and performance loss after PM insertion, is compared to some referred in the related scheduling literature metaheuristics.

A newly developed ant-colony algorithm is proposed and analyzed for solving this problem, based on a common representation of production and maintenance data, to obtain a joint schedule that is, subsequently, improved by a new local search procedure. The goal is to optimize a common objective function which takes into account both maintenance and production criteria. We compare the results obtained with our algorithm to those of an integrated genetic algorithm developed in previous works. The results and experiments carried out indicate that the proposed ant-colony algorithm provide very effective solutions for this problem.",

We also proposed a joint structure to represent an individual in with two fields: the first one for production data and the second one for maintenance data.

        "Description": "One of the most challenging issues dealing with dynamic social networks, with evolving community structures, is to understand and model the way in which these structures evolve over time. Studies on tracking and predicting community evolution generally split these networks into time-series of static networks, each including interactions aggregated over discrete time intervals (hours, days, and years). This choice of intervals is very often done arbitrarily. Yet, it is clear that the selection of the time interval over which the network is discretized has a great impact on the observation of community structures, the analysis of their evolution, and the prediction of their future events. In this paper, we propose a new framework that examines users’ activity distribution over time to provide the appropriate network splitting that would produce more accurate community event prediction. Our experiments on four real-world …",

This aspect is mainly concerned by corrective maintenance activities (equipment failure) and by condition-based maintenance (degradation). Decision-making tools are very helpful to schedule these activities. In this regard, the proposed multi-agent system provides a cooperation medium for scheduling independent jobs and maintenance operations in the flowshop sequencing problem based on the sequential and integrated strategies. The objective is then to optimise an objective function which takes into account both maintenance and production criterion. It also provides a framework in order to react to the disturbances occurring in the workshop. Moreover, it introduces a dialogue between two communities of agents (production and …",

State-of-the-art TRSs in compilers use a greedy algorithm that applies a set of rewriting rules in a predefined order (where some of the rules are not axiomatic). This leads to a loss of the ability to simplify certain expressions. E-graphs and equality saturation sidestep this issue by representing the different equivalent expressions in a compact manner from which the optimal expression can be extracted. While an e-graph-based TRS can be more powerful than a TRS that uses a greedy algorithm, it is slower because expressions may have a large or sometimes infinite number of equivalent expressions. Accelerating e-graph construction is crucial for making the use of e-graphs practical in compilers. In this paper, we present Caviar, an e-graph-based TRS for proving expressions within compilers. The main advantage of Caviar is …",

        "Description": "This paper tackles the scheduling problem of both production and flexible preventive maintenance activities on a single machine under human resource constraints. The considered human resources oversee the maintenance activities. They are characterised by a competence level and a timetabling that determines their availabilities. Our objective is to minimise a common and weighted objective function that involves both the tardiness and the earliness resulting from production and maintenance activities when considering maintenance workers. We first introduce a mathematical modelling for the studied problem that we implemented in Cplex in order to compute the optimal solutions of small instances of this problem. Secondly, we propose an improved guided local search (GLS) metaheuristic to deal with relatively large instances of the problem. Cplex is used as a reference exact method to check the solution …",

We assume that a maintenance activity requires the intervention of a human resource to be treated. These human resources are characterized by a competence level and availabilities considered as strong constraints allowing or not the maintenance activities' planning. To solve this NP-hard scheduling problem, we propose a guided local search metaheuristic that embeds a post-optimization process in order to minimize both production and maintenance delays. We implemented and experimented the proposed method on two series of benchmarks. The first one focuses on small size instances. The results show that the quality of the solutions obtained by the proposed method compared to an exact one is good, and even it reaches the optimal …",

The objective is to propose an integrated model that coordinates production schedule and predictive maintenance planning so that the total time to complete the schedule after predictive maintenance insertion is minimized. Predictive maintenance interventions are scheduled based on Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) results using a new proposed heuristic. To jointly establish an integrated scheduling of production jobs and predictive maintenance actions, we propose a tailored genetic algorithm incorporating properly designed operators. Computational experiments carried out on Taillard well known benchmarks, to which we add both PHM and maintenance data, show the efficiency of the newly proposed maintenance planning heuristic and genetic algorithm.",

To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first in the literature to address the permutation flowshop scheduling problem (PFSP) with flexible maintenance under learning and deterioration effects to minimize the makespan. Firstly, we address the PFSP with flexible maintenance and learning effects. Then, the deteriorating effect is also considered. Adaptive artificial bee colony algorithms (ABC) enhanced with Q-learning are proposed, in which the Nawaz–Enscore–Ham (NEH) heuristic and modified NEH heuristics are hybridized with a maintenance insertion heuristic to construct potential integrated initial solutions. Furthermore, a Q-learning (QL)-based neighborhood selection is applied in the employed bees phase to improve the quality of the search space solutions. Computational experiments performed on Taillard’s well-known benchmarks, augmented with both prognostic and health management (PHM) and maintenance data, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed QL-driven ABC algorithms.",

This aspect is mainly concerned by corrective maintenance activities (equipment failure). In this regard, we propose a distributed approach using multi-agent paradigm for scheduling independent jobs and maintenance operations in the flowshop sequencing problem. The proposed multi-agent system introduces a dialogue between two communities of agents (production and maintenance) based on a two-step sequential strategy: first scheduling the production jobs then inserting the preventive maintenance operations, taking the production schedule as a mandatory constraint, to generate a joint production and maintenance schedule. The objective is then to optimize a bi-objective function which takes into account both maintenance and …",

        "Description": "While polyhedral compilers have shown success in implementing advanced code transformations, they still have challenges in selecting the most profitable transformations that lead to the best speedups. This has motivated the use of machine learning to build cost models to guide the search for polyhedral optimizations. State-of-the-art polyhedral compilers have demonstrated a viable proof-of-concept of this approach. While such a proof-of-concept has shown promise, it still has significant limitations. State-of-the-art polyhedral compilers that use a deep-learning cost model only support a small subset of affine transformations, limiting their ability to apply complex code transformations. They also only support simple programs that have a single loop nest and a rectangular iteration domain, limiting their applicability to many programs. These limitations significantly impact the generality of such compilers and autoschedulers and put into question the whole approach. In this paper, we introduce LOOPer, the first polyhedral autoscheduler that uses a deep-learning based cost model and covers a large set of affine transformations and programs. It supports the exploration of a large set of affine transformations, allowing the application of complex sequences of polyhedral transformations. It also supports the optimization of programs with multiple loop nests and with rectangular and non-rectangular iteration domains, allowing the optimization of an extensive set of programs. We implement and evaluate LOOPer and show that it achieves speedups over the state-of-the-art. On the Polybench benchmark, LOOPer achieves a geometric mean speedup of 1 …",

Two types of cooperative games are suggested depending on the TRX and frequency selection strategies each using two players, one for each considered objective. A feasible solution consisting of a frequency assignment plan is built during the constructive process. At each step of the game, a player assigns a frequency to a TRX according to a given strategy. The proposed solution being part of both multi-objective optimization (MOO) and game theory (GT), we used the most important measures in these two fields: the hypervolume (HV) and the Nash value, to evaluate the performance of our solutions to able to compare our results with those …",

Because of the NP-hardness of the problem, it is difficult to cope with real FAP instances with exact or even with heuristic methods. This paper aims at solving MI-FAP using a decomposition approach and mainly proposes a generic Top-Down approach. The key idea behind the generic aspect of our approach is to link the decomposition and the resolution steps. More precisely, two generic algorithms called Top-Down and Iterative Top-Down algorithms are proposed. To validate this approach two decomposition techniques and one efficient Adaptive Genetic Algorithm (AGA-MI-FAP) are proposed. The first results demonstrate good trade-off between the quality of solutions and the execution time.",

First, we will establish that the insertion of maintenance activities during production scheduling can hedge against some changes in the shop environment. Furthermore, we will check if respecting the optimal intervals of maintenance activities guarantees a minimal robustness threshold. Then, we will try to identify from the used optimisation criteria those that allow making predictive schedules more robust. The computational experiments in a flowshop show that joint production and PM schedules are more robust than production schedules and maintenance provides an acceptable tradeoff between equipment reliability and performance loss under disruption.",

Knowing the community structure beforehand improves the identification of missing links, whereas clustering on networks with newly introduced missing links improves community detection. In this work, we examine the effectiveness of employing community structure information to predict links in static networks by combining local, quasi-local, and global similarity features to compensate for the weaknesses of each approach. Moreover, we formally defined two classes of links, called relevant links, based on the network's community structure. These links are important because they connect communities or distant nodes within communities. To solve these issues, we developed two hybrid link prediction algorithms based on network communities. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid algorithms, we conducted a …",

In the sequential strategy global scoring methods are used in a pipeline mode after local ones if the full graph is explored and the desired number of edges is not met, in an attempt to complete the missing links in the network. The integrated one combines local and global scoring algorithms together in order to add a missing link to the network. Furthermore, we present four distinct approaches to explore the network’s nodes and edges. Experiments on real-world and synthetic networks revealed that our proposed hybrid algorithms can outperform some of the state-of-the-art link-prediction methods.",

However, they need a substantial number of fitness function evaluations to discover a good approximation to the global optimum, especially for large-scale problems. Recently, surrogate-assisted algorithms have drawn increasing attention, and have shown their potential to deal with expensive complex optimization problems. This paper aims to use surrogates to approximate HHGA's (Ahmed Bacha et al., 2019) fitness functions, an efficient hyper-heuristic for solving the permutation flowshop problem, one of the most important scheduling types in modern industries. The objective is to approximate, in an online approach, the fitness function, reducing considerably the execution time of HHGA while maintaining its quality.

Moreover, the algorithm is supplemented with a clonal selection, inherited from Artificial Immune Systems (AIS), which aims to improve the algorithm exploration and exploitation abilities. Computational experiments performed over COST259 instances show the efficiency of the newly proposed evolutionary multi-objective algorithm and corroborated by the comparisons we did with the most frequently referred algorithm in the …",

        "Description": "The problem of link prediction has recently gained a lot of attention from various domains, including sociology, anthropology, information science, and computer science. In this research, we formulated the link prediction problem as an optimization problem to predict the links of any type of network and proposed two artificial bee colony-based link prediction algorithms enhanced with some neighborhood structures borrowed from genetic algorithms. In an attempt to complete the network’s missing links, the first algorithm optimizes weights, which are used in a linear combination with local and global similarity indexes, to capture the best of both schemes and compensate for each approach’s weaknesses. In the second one, we make use of the community structure of the network to help predict the missing links present in the networks. Experimental results of the proposed algorithms on a number of real-world and …",

In this context, the permutation flowshop scheduling problem (PFSP) under flexible maintenance planning is investigated by incorporating machine deteriorating and human learning effects. The objective is to minimise the expected makespan by optimising simultaneously job sequence and maintenance decisions. To study the different problem configurations with respect to machine and human related effects, two studies are carried out. In the former study, the learning effect (human effect) is applied on maintenance activities, where durations are assumed to be time varying. While in the later, besides applying the learning effect on maintenance operations, time-dependent deteriorating jobs are also considered. Given the NP …",

It is usually handled by following four main steps:(1) split the network into timeframes;(2) detect communities in each timeframe;(3) track their evolutionary behavior and (4) build a predictive model to forecast the future events. The main objective of EPredictor is to provide a flexible environment that handles the entire process of community evolution prediction with a rich set of literature methods for each step; thus enabling researchers to make valuable comparisons and consistent analysis.",

The problem is formulated as a new sequential cooperative game that optimizes simultaneously two objectives (interference cost and separation cost) while fulfilling co-channel and adjacent channel constraints, thus avoiding or minimizing interferences. The proposed game, incrementally, builds a feasible solution, according to players' strategies. At each step, a transceiver (TRX) is chosen from a set of untreated TRXs which we have not yet assigned a frequency. Then, each player chooses a frequency from its set of available frequencies, according to a given strategy, and assigns it to that TRX. Moreover, a novel assessment method based on the hypervolume (HV) metric and Nash value is described. The provided frequencies assignment plans achieve a good compromise …",

We propose a coordinated model in which the time intervals between successive maintenance tasks as well as their number are assumed to be non-fixed for each machine on the shopfloor. With such a flexible nature of maintenance activities, the resulting joint schedule is more practical and representative of real-world scenarios. Our goal is to determine the best job permutation in which flexible maintenance activities are properly incorporated. To tackle the NP-hard nature of this problem, an artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is developed to minimize the total production time (Makespan). Experiments are conducted utilizing well-known Taillard’s benchmarks, enriched with maintenance data, to compare the proposed algorithm performance against the variable neighbourhood search (VNS) method from the literature. Computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of both solution quality and computational times.",

In this study, we propose a cuckoo search-based approach for identifying the best network partitions by maximizing the modularity function. The proposed algorithm combines wisely the continuous nature of the standard cuckoo search algorithm with the discrete nature of the community detection problem to achieve the best results. Firstly, the algorithm incorporates the random key representation, which operates in a continuous space. This representation enables the algorithm to perform global and local walks, enabling both exploration and exploitation within the search space. Secondly, the algorithm utilizes the locusbased representation to handle the discrete aspect of the community detection problem. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm.",

        "Description": "In this paper, we address two versions of the permutation flowshop scheduling problem (PFSP) with makespan minimization under availability constraints with learning and deteriorating effects. Availability constraints are due to flexible maintenance activities scheduled based on prognostics and health management (PHM) results. In the first study, human learning effect is considered and position-dependent model is applied to generate variable maintenance processing times. In the second one, besides learning effect, time-dependent machine deteriorating jobs are assumed. Since the PFSP is proven to be NP-complete, improved artificial bees colony algorithms were proposed. Intense computational experiments are carried out on Taillard’s well known benchmarks, to which we add both PHM and maintenance data. The results of comparison and experiments show the efficiency of our algorithms.",

As a consequence, it appeared natural to us to consider this inherent trait of social networks in order to better the hidden link prediction problem’s resolution. In this paper, we propose a supervised learning algorithm that incorporates community information as a feature alongside other similarity metrics. The objective is to show that the information about the network’s community structure will enhance the accuracy of the hidden link prediction in social networks. We tested the F1-score accuracy of the proposed model with four classifiers: SVM with an “rbf” kernel, Naive Bayes, random forest and K-NN. Experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of community information can only improve the quality of the hidden link prediction.",

The goal is to optimize two criteria simultaneously: minimization of total completion time (makespan) for production part and minimization of total Earliness/Tardiness of PM activities for maintenance part. Moreover, to cope with the concept of game types we proposed two player behaviors: non-rational and rational behavior. In this research, the Nash equilibrium in game theory based approach is used to deal with the multiple objectives. Computational experiment on both standard PFSP problems and non- standard PM instances shows the effectiveness of the proposed solving algorithms.",

It is applied for both production and joint production and maintenance scheduling as well. ETOMA architecture is composed of three modules: Develop, Test and Blackboard. The first one defines all agents that model the floor shop and their behavior. The second one takes care of testing the scheduling solution by using Taillard benchmarks depending on floor shop types. The considered types are Flow-shop, Job-shop and Open-shop. Finally, the Blackboard insures communication between the two predefined modules. ETOMA allows developing and testing any scheduling solution without imposing a specific architecture for agents. Moreover, ETOMA provides at the end of simulations a report composed of a recapitulative table or a curve according to user choice.",

Despite extensive research in this area, existing approaches either require repetitive computations or fail to capture key community behavioral events, both of which limit the ability to generate timely and actionable insights. Efficiently tracking community structures is crucial for real-time decision-making in rapidly evolving networks, while capturing behavioral events is necessary for understanding deeper community dynamics. This study addresses these limitations by proposing a more efficient and adaptive solution. It aims to answer the following questions: How can we efficiently track community structures without recomputation? How can we detect significant community events over time …",

This study tackles this crucial issue through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Representation Learning (RL). Several real-world, complex power system datasets characterized by their large size, dynamic nature, and high imbalance are examined. EDA serves as a fundamental step to provide insights into power system event scenarios, supported by a comprehensive preprocessing strategy that includes managing missing values, reducing dimensionality, denoising, removing outliers, and addressing class imbalance. Missing values are thoughtfully handled by evaluating mean values. Dimensionality reduction involves removing insignificant features that might provide misleading information, along with integrating Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Class-specific denoising …",

This paper addresses the challenge of community detection in multiplex networks, which model multiple types of relationships to reflect reality. Our approach consists of two key steps. First, we employ multiplex network flattening techniques to transform it into a one-dimensional network. Second, we introduce a cuckoo searchbased algorithm to maximize the modularity function and identify the best network partitions. Our algorithm strategically combines the continuous aspects of the standard cuckoo search algorithm with the discrete nature of community detection, to achieve better results. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world multiplex networks demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.",

This problem can be modeled as an NP-hard optimization problem. Inspired from [25] [24] that combined Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Reinforcement Learning on large action-space environments, we adapt MCTS for the problem of Community Detection in Social Networks and propose MCTS-CD. MCTS-CD is an arm-bandit [2] anytime algorithm. We show that when compared to reference algorithms for CD such as Louvain [1], with allocating the same amount of resources, MCTS-CD acheives better results on many benchmark datasets such as Zachary Karate Club, Dolphin and the Pol Books datasets.",

        "Description": "Hyper-heuristics can be applied to solve complex optimization problems. Recently, an efficient hyper-heuristic (HHGA) was proposed for solving the permutation flowshop problem (PFSP), one of the most important scheduling type in modern industries. HHGA is a hyper genetic algorithm (GA) that evolves GAs to solve the PFSP. It designs, automatically, efficient GA per instance. However, HHGA evolves in a huge search space (more than 9 million GAs). Moreover, at each generation, HHGA needs to execute many GAs, which requires a very large number of fitness evaluations; thus, inducing huge computational overhead. To overcome this problem, this paper aims at integrating machine learning techniques into HHGA. The objective is to approximate, in an offline approach, the fitness function, reducing considerably the execution time of HHGA while maintaining its quality.

        "Description": "In the era of rapidly expanding social networks, community detection within social graphs plays a pivotal role in various applications such as targeted marketing, content recommendations, and understanding social dynamics. Community detection problem consists of finding a strategy for detecting cohesive groups, based on shared interests, choices, and preferences, given a social network where nodes represent users and edges represent interactions between them. In this work, we propose a hybrid method for the community detection problem that encompasses both traditional tree search algorithms and deep learning techniques. We begin by introducing a beam-search algorithm with a modularity-based agglomeration function as a foundation. To enhance its performance, we further hybridize this approach by incorporating DeepWalk embeddings into the process and leveraging a novel similarity metric for community structure assessment. Experimentation on both synthetic and real-world networks demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, particularly excelling in small to medium-sized networks, outperforming widely adopted methods.",

As a consequence, it appeared natural to us to consider this inherent trait of social networks in order to better the hidden link prediction problem's resolution. In this paper, we propose a supervised learning algorithm that incorporates community information as a feature alongside other similarity metrics. The objective is to show that the information about the network's community structure will enhance the accuracy of the hidden link prediction in social networks. We tested the F1-score accuracy of the proposed model with four classifiers: SVM with an “rbf” kernel, Naive Bayes, random forest and K-NN. Experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of community information can only improve the quality of the hidden link prediction.",

In this paper, we analyze communities’ evolution prediction accuracy in dynamic social networks. The proposed approach combines two key concepts of the process, aiming to enrich the prediction model by additional information that could improve the results:(1) a tailored network splitting that results in snapshots of different periods rather than a static one, and (2) the change rates of communities’ features that characterize them over time instead of absolute values of features. Our experiments on four realworld social networks confirm that community evolution prediction can be achieved with a very high accuracy by using both tailored network splitting as a first step of prediction process and change rates of features.",

These studies follow two approaches, namely a bottom-up, and a top-down one. Three decomposition methods and an adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) are associated with these approaches. The experimental results obtained for MI-FAP problems show a good trade-off between the quality of the solution and the execution time of the different algorithms.",

Cette hypothèse n’est pourtant pas fidèle à la réalité des ateliers de production. Cet article présente une nouvelle approche proactive-réactive pour la résolution du problème de l’ordonnancement conjoint de la production et la maintenance sur une machine. L’approche proposée prend en compte les incertitudes des données du problème. Ces incertitudes peuvent être des imprécisions relatives aux estimations des durées opératoires des tâches ou bien des incertitudes concernant l’apparition ou non d’événements pouvant affecter le déroulement du processus de production. Pour modéliser l’imprécision, nous utilisons la logique floue et pour traiter les différents événements nous utilisons l’approche par scénarios. La méthode proposée consiste en deux phases : (1) une phase proactive dans laquelle un ordonnancement sous incertitudes de base est généré   (2) une phase réactive pour la prise en compte des événements temps réels en vue d’adapter l’ordonnancement de base aux nouvelles données. Nous utilisons la technologie agent comme support de modélisation de l'atelier de production\"",

Computational experiments are conducted on a large set of instances and the resulting genetic algorithm gives the best results so far.",

Graph burning offers a simplified deterministic model for addressing the NP-complete Graph Burning Problem. Acknowledging the unique characteristics of this problem, this paper introduces an efficient guided local search approach, leveraging betweenness centrality to initialize the solution process and integrating an augmented function with penalty terms to optimize the burning sequence. Using a binary search mechanism, candidate values are iteratively tested. Experimental results on 15 benchmark graphs demonstrate the algorithm’s superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

        "Description": "Community detection is a landmark problem in social network analysis. To address this challenge, we propose SPACED: Spaced Positional Autoencoder for Community Embedding Detection, a deep learning-based approach designed to effectively tackle the complexities of community detection in social networks. SPACED generates neighborhood-aware embeddings of network nodes using an autoencoder architecture. These embeddings are then refined through a mixed learning strategy with generated community centers, making them more community-aware. This approach helps unravel network communities through an appropriate clustering strategy. Experimental evaluations across synthetic and real-world networks, as well as comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, demonstrate the high competitiveness and often superiority of SPACED for community detection while maintaining reasonable time complexities.",

In this work, a hybridization of Q-Learning algorithm and Game theory is proposed to deal with the multi-objective Frequency Assignment Problem (FAP) in cellular networks considering two competing objectives namely interference and separation costs. The game embeds two learning players (agents), one for each objective. It occurs in a number of episodes in which a set of actions are considered to generate a frequency assignment plan providing a good trade-o between the two considered con icting objectives. The results of the experiments over two real-world cellular networks of two US cities, using Hypervolume and Nash metrics demonstrated the e ectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Optimizing compilers focus on modifying code so that it runs faster and uses the underlying hardware more efficiently.To do so, optimizing compilers often need to simplify or prove algebraic expressions, whether they were arithmetic or boolean. They generally use a term rewriting system that transforms syntactically the given expressions to either prove them or simplify them. A term rewriting system is essentially composed of a set of rewrite rules along with an algorithm that determines how these rules will be applied.",

        "Description": "Palmprint is one of the modalities that offer high recognition accuracy. The recognition process depends on an optimized ROI (Region of Interest) extraction. This extraction is affected by several factors including the device used and the acquisition conditions. The acquisition mode can alter some image properties like rotation, translation and scale. Some devices are designed to maintain hand in a fixed position and delimit a subspace of the hand. On the other hand, contactless devices offer more convenience and flexibility but lead to altered images. ROI extraction methods must consider the acquisition device (with contact or contactless). In this paper, we propose a ROI extraction method that addresses this issue. We test our method on two databases PolyU and CASIA which illustrate the impact of using contactless device unlike the PolyU device. Then, we test performances of the palmprint biometric system.

Some models classify threats by type of attacks, others by specific attacks and other by using vulnerabilities and threat agent.

For example, to design security techniques for wireless biometric card, one should identify all threats facing this kind of device. In this paper, a comparative study and synthesis to help choose the most fitting model, depending on the security problems addressed, is given.",

The main limit of these systems is the lack of information in terms of quantity (number of discriminant features) and quality (diversity of information, correlation…). Using multiple sources of information and/or treatment is a solution to overcome these problems and enhance system performances. Performance requirements of current systems related to context use involve designed solutions that optimally satisfy security requirements. This can represent an optimization problem that aims at searching the optimal solution matching security needs. In our study, we are interested in combining different score level rules using an evolutionary algorithm. We use Genetic Algorithm to derive a score fusion function based on primitive operations. The process uses an optimized tree to determine function …",

Chaff-points generation process consists of creating a set of chaff points similar to authentic minutiae feature representation. Squares based chaff-points generation consist of delimiting a square boundary around each chaff-point in such a way that a square must never overlap with other squares. Unlike the typical squares method where chaff-points and their boundaries are generated sequentially, in our proposal, the referred chaff-points are generated all together then the knapsack problem formulation is used along with 0/1 dynamic programing resolution to determine if each chaff-point respects the constraints. The experiments results show that the chaff-points generation based on Knapsack method generates the referred number of chaff-points …",

This extraction is affected by several factors including the device used and the acquisition conditions. The acquisition step can alter some image properties like rotation, translation and scale. Some devices are designed to maintain hand in a fixed position and delimit a subspace of the hand. On the other hand, contactless devices offer more convenience and flexibility but lead to altered images. ROI extraction methods must consider the acquisition device (with contact or contactless). In this paper, we propose palmprint recognition system considering this issue. A ROI extraction method is implemented and tested on different databases taking into account the acquisition device with different sensor conditions. Our research to test this method, are conducted on …",

However, a major limitation is that individuals’ fingerprint information cannot be easily changed if compromised. The fuzzy vault is a promising technique that secures fingerprint data by generating a set of data from the fingerprint using an injective function, preventing the original fingerprint from being regenerated. Nevertheless, the fingerprint fuzzy vault is computationally intensive and requires substantial memory resources. We propose enhancing the performance of fingerprint fuzzy vaults and reducing resource consumption using a new chaff point generation technique based on square boundaries and composite representation. We conducted integration testing along with detailed benchmarking of the fingerprint fuzzy vault using square-boundary …",

Supported by author publication charges (APC), its hallmarks are a rapid peer review and publication process with open access to all readers. Unlike IEEE's traditional Transactions or Journals, reviews are \"binary\", in that reviewers will either Accept or Reject an article in the form it is submitted in order to achieve rapid turnaround. Especially encouraged are submissions on:\n\nMultidisciplinary topics, or applications-oriented articles and negative results that do not fit within the scope of IEEE's traditional journals.\nPractical articles discussing new experiments or measurement techniques, interesting solutions to engineering.\nDevelopment of new or improved fabrication or manufacturing techniques.\nReviews or survey articles of new or evolving fields oriented to assist others in understanding the new area.",

Therefore, it is necessary to develop an automated fall detection system to make them more independent and to mitigate the physical and psychological consequences of falls. Such a system can lower the death rate among dependent people who live alone. This paper presents a review of vision-based techniques, algorithms and databases used in detecting falls. Recently proposed systems are analyzed and compared. The literature review underscores the promising potential of camera-based fall detection systems and highlights areas for further research and development.",

        "Description": "Chaff-points generation is one of the most important steps in the fuzzy vault encryption process. This phase is time and computational resource consuming. Several methods were proposed in the literature to optimize this step for resource constrained environments. The challenge is to generate the desired number of chaff-points in a minimum and homogeneous time and a minimum amount of computational re-sources. In this paper, we propose a new chaff-points generation method based on genetic algorithm and non-fixed squares boundaries for resource constrained devices. The obtained results showed that our method gives the desired number of chaff-points in a better time than other methods.",

The current advances in computing, networking technology and software have spurred a lot of research interest in cluster and internet computing, as demonstrated in Cloud and Grid computing, and distributed high performance data centers.\n\nIn the last few years, we have seen an increased interest in developing applications, software tools, communications protocols and high performance data centers, Grids and cloud computing sites to capitalize on these advances and initiatives. Publications about these developments currently appear in several journals that either focus on the communications field, or on parallel and distributed computing with a strong emphasis on the parallel algorithms. Cluster Computing Journal will uniquely address the latest results in integrating these three fields to support the development of high performance parallel distributed computing systems and their applications. The journal will be an important source of information for the growing number of researchers, developers and users of High Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing environments. In these environments, parallel and/or distributed computing techniques are applied to the solution of large-scale scientific and engineering applications running on clusters, cloud computing and/or distributed data centers.",

Significant experimental, numerical or theoretical contributions advancing the understanding of plastic behaviour of solids are of special interest, together with studies relating macroscopic to the microscopic behaviour of solids. Papers on modeling of finite nonlinear elastic deformation, with similarities to modeling of plastic deformation, are also welcome.\n\nThe Journal will contain research papers, review articles, research notes, letters to the editor, and academic advertisements (books, journals, conferences, and symposia). Strain-rate dependent and strain-rate independent constitutive models to predict observed phemonena during quasi-static, dynamic or cyclic thermo-mechanical loading, behaviour of granular or porous solids under high confining pressures and at high temperatures, multiscale modeling of various deformation mechanisms (dislocation, twinning, and phase transformation), and models with capability for predicting the behaviour of composite materials based onknown plastic behaviour of matrix and fibers in such materials, are some examples of the main themes of this journal. Revealing applications of the new models of plasticity, including modelling of the observed phenomena in metal forming processes are also of interest.",
