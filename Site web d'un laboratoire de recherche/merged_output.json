CI enables the development of strategies that confer companies a significant competitive advantage. The appropriate decisions are taken when all required data are considered. As the amount of data grows very fast inside and outside of an enterprise, exploiting these mountains of data efficiently became a crucial need. Note that such data are usually multiples, heterogeneous, autonomous and distributed. The main issue is related to the identification and resolution of structural and semantic heterogeneity between data, usually spread in multiple sources. Data integration is a significant solution that addresses these problems. Data Warehouse (DW) is viewed as Data Integration System (DIS) that consolidates several data sources in the …",

C’est le degré de la prise en charge du profil de l’apprenant. Ainsi, il est important de concevoir un dispositif mettant en œuvre une série d’évaluations. Nous pensons que l’évaluation, dans sa fonction formative, est au cœur de l’apprentissage vu sa fonction régulatrice qui est primordiale.Summary: In this paper, we will present a problematic that we judge important to take in consideration during the development of a training environment that correspond to the degree of taking account of the learner profile. So, it is important to have a module determined with a set of assessments. We think that the evaluation, in its formative function, is the center of learning process since its regulation function is very important.",

By analysing various aspects of individual and group processes from both the qualitative and the quantitative perspectives, it is possible to identify weaknesses of the course design and allow for adjustment and fine tuning. This work presents a model for analysing CSCL processes and consists of five dimensions: participation, interaction, social presence, cognitive presence and teaching presence. The model extends and combines the work of Henri (1992) and Garrison & Anderson (2003). Practical examples of the model application are reported in the context of pre-service teacher training.",

Internet, and in particular the World Wide Web, is becoming a learning space which is used increasingly in several educational contexts from secondary schools to post graduate courses. Learners can choose to take training modules and, in some cases, entire programs through the Net; the on line environment may be the only possibility to acquire knowledge on some topics for learners who do not have the opportunity to attend traditional classes; besides the communicative power of Internet tools can allow the activation of new ways of teaching/learning. As the number of on line learners is increasing, it is crucial for training centers and institutions to create effective on-line learning environments according to the specific needs of each learner. In fact, a lot of aspects have to be taken into account to project and activate a good distance course: effective presentation of contents, consideration of individual differences of users, adoption of several models according to educational objectives, and so on.",

                "Description": "Palmprint is one of the modalities that offer high recognition accuracy. The recognition process depends on an optimized ROI (Region of Interest) extraction. This extraction is affected by several factors including the device used and the acquisition conditions. The acquisition step can alter some image properties like rotation, translation and scale. Some devices are designed to maintain hand in a fixed position and delimit a subspace of the hand. On the other hand, contactless devices offer more convenience and flexibility but lead to altered images. ROI extraction methods must consider the acquisition device (with contact or contactless). In this paper, we propose palmprint recognition system considering this issue. A ROI extraction method is implemented and tested on different databases taking into account the acquisition device with different sensor conditions. Our research to test this method, are conducted on …",

                    "scope": "Memes have been defined as basic units of transferrable information that reside in the brain and are propagated across populations through the process of imitation. From an algorithmic point of view, memes have come to be regarded as building-blocks of prior knowledge, expressed in arbitrary computational representations (e.g., local search heuristics, fuzzy rules, neural models, etc.), that have been acquired through experience by a human or machine, and can be imitated (i.e., reused) across problems.\n\nThe Memetic Computing journal welcomes papers incorporating the aforementioned socio-cultural notion of memes into artificial systems, with particular emphasis on enhancing the efficacy of computational and artificial intelligence techniques for search, optimization, and machine learning through explicit prior knowledge incorporation. The goal of the journal is to thus be an outlet for high quality theoretical and applied research on hybrid, knowledge-driven computational approaches that may be characterized under any of the following categories of memetics:\n\nType 1: General-purpose algorithms integrated with human-crafted heuristics that capture some form of prior domain knowledge; e.g., traditional memetic algorithms hybridizing evolutionary global search with a problem-specific local search.\nType 2: Algorithms with the ability to automatically select, adapt, and reuse the most appropriate heuristics from a diverse pool of available choices; e.g., learning a mapping between global search operators and multiple local search schemes, given an optimization problem at hand.\nType 3: Algorithms that autonomously learn with experience, adaptively reusing data and/or machine learning models drawn from related problems as prior knowledge in new target tasks of interest; examples include, but are not limited to, transfer learning and optimization, multi-task learning and optimization, or any other multi-X evolutionary learning and optimization methodologies.",

From 1998, NBiS had been held successfully every year with high quality papers being presented. Since the 9-th NBiS in 2006, which was held in Krakow, Poland, NBiS has been promoted to an International Conference.\n\nNBiS is becoming a very important event for the network research community and is improved every year in both quality and quantity. The NBiS International Conference moves around the world in all continents: NBiS-2008 in Turin, Italy; NBiS-2007 in Regensburg, Germany; NBIS-2009 in Indianapolis, USA; NBiS-2010 in Takayama, Japan; NBiS-2011 in Tirana, Albania; NBiS-2012 in Melbourne, Australia; NBiS-2013 in Gwangju Korea; and NBiS-2014 in Salerno, Italy.\nThis year NBiS-2015 will be held in Taipei, Taiwan.\n\nThe main objective of NBiS is to bring together researchers from both network systems and information systems with the aim of encouraging the exchange of ideas and experience between these two communities. It will represent an international forum to give an overview of the most recent trends. In the past decade, our network infrastructures have undergone radical changes. It has evolved from a small number of interconnected computer networks to a global socio-technical infrastructure, where people communicate and interact spontaneously in cyberspace and with the cyber physical world, create content and share knowledge over a network of heterogeneous networks. In the future, global society will increasingly rely on socio-technical networks designed in harmony with societal values and economic viability, with enhanced security, privacy, resilience, availability and manageability, and the ability to incorporate as yet unforeseen technologies, applications and services.",

                "Description": "Programmers spend a lot of time and effort optimizing their code to make it run faster, this has led compiler researchers to focus on developing automatic optimization techniques that allow to automatically improve program performance. Such techniques aim to transform programs to exploit more efficiently the underlying hardware. Efficient implementations of automatic optimization techniques require precise cost models, they evaluate whether applying a sequence of code transformations reduces the execution time of the program. Building an analytical cost model to do so is hard in modern x86 architectures due to the complexity of the microarchitecture. In this work, we present a novel deep learning-based cost model for automatic code optimization. This cost model is integrated into an auto-scheduler that enables Tiramisu compiler to select the best code transformations for a given program. The input of the proposed model is a tree-structured set of high-level features representing the unoptimized code along with a sequence of code transformations, the cost model predicts the speedup expected when the code transformations are applied. To train the model, we built a 1.8 million points dataset consisting of transformed synthetic Tiramisu programs. The proposed model achieves a low error rate of 16% MAPE on predicting speedups. Furthermore, the model is proven effective at ranking code transformation candidates with an nDCG score of 98%. Experiments on real-world image processing, deep learning, and scientific computing programs show that the auto-scheduler finds competitive solutions 95 times faster when it uses the proposed cost …",

It consists of extracting and processing different failure types features to set up a knowledge base, which contains different failure types. The first phase consists in pre-processing the measured signals by aggregating them and preparing the data in exploitable formats for the clustering. The second phase ensures the induction machine operating mode diagnosis. A measured signals clustering is performed to build classes where each one represents a health state. A variable neighborhood search (VNS) metaheuristic is designed for data clustering. Moreover, VNS is hybridized with a classical mechanics-inspired optimization (CMO) metaheuristic to balance global exploration and local exploitation during the evolutionary process. The third phase consists of two-step failure detection, setting up a knowledge base containing different failure types, and defining a representative model for each failure type. In the learning step, different class features are extracted and inserted in the knowledge base to be used during the decision step. The proposed metaheuristic-based failure detection diagnosis approach is evaluated using PRONOSTIA and CWR bearing data experimental platforms vibration and temperature measurements. The achieved results clearly demonstrate the failure detection and diagnosis, efficiency, and effectiveness of the proposed metaheuristic approach.",

They perform an implicit enumeration of the search space instead of exhaustive one. Based on a pruning technique, they reduce considerably the computation time required to explore the whole search space. Nevertheless, these algorithms remain inefficient when dealing with large combinatorial optimization instances. They are time-intensive and they require a huge computing power to be solved optimally. Nowadays, multi-core-based processors and GPU accelerators are often coupled together to achieve impressive performances. However, classical B&B algorithms must be rethought to deal with their two divergent architectures.

APRIORI and FP-GROWTH are the most popular and used algorithms nowadays for extracting such rules. They are exact methods that consist of two phases. First, frequent itemsets are generated. Then, the latter are used to generate rules. The main drawback of both algorithms is their high execution time. To overcome this drawback, metaheuristics have been proposed. Moreover, to optimize the execution time, since the amount of data is in continuous growth, some parallel architectures can be found in the literature. In this paper, we present an overview of existing literature that investigate the ARM problem using both metaheuristics and parallelism. We will focus on the recent algorithms that tackle these problems using approximate methods and …",

                "Description": "In this paper we present a study that looks at modelling drivers’ behaviour with a view to contribute to the problem of road rage. The approach we adopt is based on agent technology, particularly multi-agent systems. Each driver is represented by a software agent. A virtual environment is used to simulate drivers’ behaviour, thus enabling us to observe the conditions leading to road rage. The simulated model is then used to suggest possible ways of alleviating this societal problem. Our agents are equipped with an emotional module which will make their behaviours more human-like. For this, we propose a computational emotion model based on the OCC model and probabilistic cognitive maps. The key influencing factors that are included in the model are personality, emotions and some social/personal attributes.",

More and more domains of the daily life take advantage of the available tools (medicine, trade, meteorology…). However, such tools are confronted to a particular problem: the great number of characteristics that qualify data samples. They are more or less victims of the abundance of information.Sat domain benefits from the appearance of powerful solvers that can process huge amounts of data in short times. This paper presents an approach for translating timetable problems (which are a particular case of DSS), into a Boolean formula, which is then provided to an environment that allows experimenting different heuristics in order to extract solutions that satisfy a maximum number of clauses (Max-Sat problem). Finally, the best solutions are back-translated into the original problem in order to find an adequate schedule that satisfies the characteristics and constraints of the timetable problem.",

                "Description": "Partitioning has a big impact on cost/performance characteristics of the system under design. It is an NP-Complete problem that deals with the different constraints relative to the system and the underlying target architecture. The existing partitioning approaches have a major drawback: they are generally dedicated to particular classes of applications and/or target architectures and this makes them difficult to generalize as soon as small changes are performed on the system under design. Besides, it is generally difficult to include new strategies that might be better suited to the applications to partition. This paper introduces a parallel environment that offers the user the opportunity to describe, experiment new heuristics and test different sets of parameters. It is also possible to explore new hybridization schemes between different strategies.",

                "Description": "Palmprint is one of the modalities that offer high recognition accuracy. The recognition process depends on an optimized ROI (Region of Interest) extraction. This extraction is affected by several factors including the device used and the acquisition conditions. The acquisition step can alter some image properties like rotation, translation and scale. Some devices are designed to maintain hand in a fixed position and delimit a subspace of the hand. On the other hand, contactless devices offer more convenience and flexibility but lead to altered images. ROI extraction methods must consider the acquisition device (with contact or contactless). In this paper, we propose palmprint recognition system considering this issue. A ROI extraction method is implemented and tested on different databases taking into account the acquisition device with different sensor conditions. Our research to test this method, are conducted on …",

Machine Learning for malware detection has emerged as a new trend and is becoming increasingly effective. Indeed, malware generate a tremendous amount of data that should be analyzed and used to detect them. The aim of this paper is to propose a Machine Learning approach to detect both recent and old malware by converting them into images. This approach, which consists of two phases, is based on Transfer Learning through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that extract features from malware images. These features are used to determine the maliciousness of a particular file. We define six strategies, each one is a combination of two image types (Grayscale and Color) and three CNN architectures (VGG, ResNet and Inception). Experimental evaluation has been done to test these six strategies. The strategy that fulfills the most testing goals is Grayscale+ ResNet with a testing accuracy of 90.08%. Even if the first results are promising, the future work is to automate the fine-tuning of the parameters to go through all possible values and obtain the best ones.",

In this paper, we analyze communities’ evolution prediction accuracy in dynamic social networks. The proposed approach combines two key concepts of the process, aiming to enrich the prediction model by additional information that could improve the results:(1) a tailored network splitting that results in snapshots of different periods rather than a static one, and (2) the change rates of communities’ features that characterize them over time instead of absolute values of features. Our experiments on four realworld social networks confirm that community evolution prediction can be achieved with a very high accuracy by using both tailored network splitting as a first step of prediction process and change rates of features.",

                "Description": "Les accélérateurs matériels ont été depuis longtemps utilisés pour booster les performances dans les MPSoC. Cependant, ces derniers introduisent un surplus d’occupation de surface sur ces systèmes. Le travail présenté dans cet article présente un outil pour trouver un compromis entre l’accélération apportée par ces accélérateurs matériels et la surface occupée par ces derniers. Pour ce faire, nous proposons d’utiliser un nouveau type d’architectures basé sur le partage d’accélérateurs matériels. Nous présentons une approche d’exploration de l’espace de conception (ou DSE pour Design Space Exploration) basée sur un algorithme génétique hybridé à un nouveau type de recherche locale (PVNS), pour l’exploration bi-objectif de l’espace de conception, dans les architectures à base de partage d’accélérateurs matériels. L’approche proposée a été testée sur trois applications: le Multiple Target Tracking (MTT), le JPEG et une application synthétique. Notre algorithme apporte un gain en temps d’exploration pouvant atteindre les 99.86% par rapport aux travaux existants basés sur un modèle mixte de programmation linéaire en nombres entiers (MILP), tout en y ajoutant la considération de la contrainte d’accélération. Cette approche permet une réduction de la surface occupée par les accélérateurs pouvant atteindre les 81, 48%, par rapport à une implémentation sans partage d’accélérateurs.",

With the evolution of Semantic Web services (SWs) within organizations and their uses in a large-scale, composition of services in a distributed setting has become a real challenge. A mechanism for automatic composition of SWs according to their functionality is necessary, since the features are the most important thing that partners seek. In this paper, we describe a distributed approach to automatic composition of SWs, which supports the complexity of both SWs and the task at hand. The approach is based on the notion of alignment of OWL-S, in order to achieve semantic interoperability in a heterogeneous and distributed architecture, to ensure correct operation of Web services provided, and meet the needs and users’ preferences. The objective is to optimize the time of the completion of the automatic composition of SWs, and to overcome the problem of communication within and between SWs and network saturation.",

                "Description": "B&B algorithms are well known techniques for exact solving of combinatorial optimization problems (COP). They perform an implicit enumeration of the search space instead of exhaustive one. Based on a pruning technique, they reduce considerably the computation time required to explore the whole search space. Nevertheless, these algorithms remain inefficient when dealing with large combinatorial optimization instances. They are time-intensive and they require a huge computing power to be solved optimally. Nowadays, multi-core-based processors and GPU accelerators are often coupled together to achieve impressive performances. However, classical B&B algorithms must be rethought to deal with their two divergent architectures. In this paper, we propose a new B&B approach exploiting both the multi-core aspect of actual processors and GPU accelerators. The proposed approaches have been executed to solve FSP instances that are well-known combinatorial optimization benchmarks. Real experiments have been carried out on an Intel Xeon 64-bit quad-core processor E5520 coupled to an Nvidia Tesla C2075 GPU device. The results show that our hybrid B&B approach speeds up the execution time up to x123 over the sequential mono-core B&B algorithm.",

Initial Public Offering (IPO) is a process based on finding a reasonable offering price or the price of the first assets sale by a firm to public. The study of the firms' strategic choices at the IPO requires the use of formal tools like game theory. This article is about the study, analysis and simulation of a firm's dynamic evolution at IPO using the EGT (Evolutionary Game Theory) as a formal framework for IPO strategies (offering prices) through modeling a financial market by multi-agent system. The firm in the system is a cognitive agent built around a classifier system. Simulations with our prototype allow us to deduce the factors that cause IPO under pricing.",

                "Description": "This work consists in simulating a real time interbank gross payment system (RTGS) through a multi-agent model, to analyze the evolution of the liquidity brought by the banks to the system. In this model, each bank chooses the amount of a daily liquidity provided in the system on the basis of costs minimization (costs of liquidity and delaying) by taking into account the liquidity brought by the other banks. Banks agents reasoning is based on a repeated aggregate game of over several payment days where each bank plays against the other banks. For adaptive behaviour we integrate into bank agents a learning classifier system. We carry out then several simulations to follow the system total liquidity evolution as that of each bank agent with varying costs coefficients. The question to be answered is: what are the cash amounts that banks must provide and under what constraints (costs of liquidity and delaying) the system beyond the lack of liquidity (illiquidity)? We find that liquidity e volution depends on costs coefficients.",

Modelling and simulating these systems by means of agent systems, i.e., through artificial markets is a valuable approach. In this article, we present our model of asynchronous artificial market consisting of a set of adaptive and heterogeneous agents in interaction. These agents represent the various market participants (investors and institutions). Investor Agents have advanced mental models for ordinary investors which do not relay on fundamental or technical analysis methods. On one hand, these models are based on the risk tolerance and on the other hand on the information gathered by the agents. This information results from overhearing influential investors in the market or the order books. We model the system through investor agents using learning classifier systems as reasoning models. As a result, our artificial market allows the study of overhearing impacts on the market. We also present the experimental evaluation results of our model.",

                "Description": "Tiramisu is a polyhedral compiler for generating fast code. It provides high level scheduling commands to optimize programs. Selecting what scheduling commands to apply to a piece of code, the parameters of those commands, and the ordering between them is a challenging task. It requires substantial time, effort, and expertise to construct beneficial combinations of optimizations that improve the run-time of the program. Our work is an attempt to automate code optimization within the Tiramisu framework, by leveraging the advances in deep learning techniques. More concretely, we aim to use a neural-network-based cost model to evaluate schedules, which would allow fast and efficient search space exploration to find well-performing schedules for an input program. We developed a code generation module for Tiramisu and used it to construct a starting dataset to train our neural network.",

Therefore, a Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) is one of the key components of solar electricity generation. It is used to extract the maximum power point (MPP) produced by a PVS. In this paper, we present an intelligent Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to track the MPP thereby increasing the performance of the PVS. The proposed ACO algorithm is developed in Matlab/Simulink environment. Furthermore, the results obtained from the ACO algorithm are compared with the well-known conventional Perturb and Observe (P&O) algorithm.",

The proposed approaches aim to show that the efficiency of GAs in solving flowshop problems can be improved significantly by tailoring the various AIS operators to suit the problem structure. The proposed hybridization scheme is applied in two ways: (1) the first hybrid of GA and AIS introduces vaccination (Jiao and Wang, IEEE Trans Syst Man Sybernetics Part A Syst Hum 30(5):552–561, 2000) into the field of GAs based on the theory of immunity in biology, (2) the second takes its inspiration on the immune network theory (Perelson, Immunol Rev 110(1):5–36, 1989), and applied it to the field of GAs. The proposed hybrid metaheuristics produce high quality solutions as proved by the tests performed over Taillard’s (Eur J Oper Res 64(2):278 …",

                "Description": "This paper introduces a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to address the challenges associated with configuring and optimizing genetic algorithms (GAs) for solving difficult combinatorial or non-linear problems. The proposed RL+GA method was specifically tested on the flow shop scheduling problem (FSP). The hybrid algorithm incorporates neural networks (NN) and uses the off-policy method Q-learning or the on-policy method Sarsa(0) to control two key genetic algorithm (GA) operators: parent selection mechanism and mutation. At each generation, the RL agent's action is determining the selection method, the probability of the parent selection and the probability of the offspring mutation. This allows the RL agent to dynamically adjust the selection and mutation based on its learned policy. The results of the study highlight the effectiveness of the RL+GA approach in improving the performance of the primitive GA. They also demonstrate its ability to learn and adapt from population diversity and solution improvements over time. This adaptability leads to improved scheduling solutions compared to static parameter configurations while maintaining population diversity throughout the evolutionary process.",

However, accurately identifying communities is challenging due to the complex nature of social networks. To address this challenge, we propose CD-BSO, an innovative metaheuristic based on brainstorming. CD-BSO leverages network knowledge through specialized initialization and solution generation operators designed to capture social network characteristics. In the initialization phase, a technique combining Depth-First Search (DFS) is employed to consider both connectivity and information diffusion, ensuring accurate community representation. The generation step introduces search operators that consider link formation and node similarity, facilitating convergence towards a community structure that closely resembles the network's actual structure.

                "Description": "Over the past two decades, the use of reinforcement learning (RL) for optimization in various application areas, including wireless networks, has increased tremendously, resulting in a wide range of research in the literature. In this work, a hybridization of Q-Learning algorithm and Game theory is proposed to deal with the multi-objective Frequency Assignment Problem (FAP) in cellular networks considering two competing objectives namely interference and separation costs. The game embeds two learning players (agents), one for each objective. It occurs in a number of episodes in which a set of actions are considered to generate a frequency assignment plan providing a good trade-o between the two considered con icting objectives. The results of the experiments over two real-world cellular networks of two US cities, using Hypervolume and Nash metrics demonstrated the e ectiveness of the proposed approach.",

                "Description": "New mobile applications, with growing computing requirements on the one hand, and limited battery capacity on the other, need intelligent and efficient solutions to extend battery life while reducing latency. To tackle this problem, a new emerging paradigm known as Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) has been introduced, ensuring optimal use of network resources while minimizing latency. The computational offloading problem is part of this context. It allows the transfer of the computation of traffic and services from a centralized cloud to the edge of the network and then closer to the client. We deal in this work, with the offloading problem considering a multi-user model system in an unbalanced MEC architecture, achieving a trade-off between energy consumption, latency and the cost to access the edge cloud server. Since the NP-hadness of this problem, the exact methods are not suitbale, mainly for big instances. To solve this challenging issue, we propose an efficient hybrid genetic algorithm based on a genetic algorithm and a VNS variable neighborhood search taking into account the problem specificity. In order to deduce the best combination that provides the solution with the lowest cost, several possible hybridization schemes are proposed: a sequential hybridization, and two memetic algorithms where the local search is integrated into the genetic evolutionary process to overcome the shortcomings of the genetic algorithm, improving the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the algorithm. Both genetic operators (mutation and crossover) and VNS are adapted to our problem, making them more effective in finding the offloading …",

From 1998, NBiS had been held successfully every year with high quality papers being presented. Since the 9-th NBiS in 2006, which was held in Krakow, Poland, NBiS has been promoted to an International Conference.\n\nNBiS is becoming a very important event for the network research community and is improved every year in both quality and quantity. The NBiS International Conference moves around the world in all continents: NBiS-2008 in Turin, Italy; NBiS-2007 in Regensburg, Germany; NBIS-2009 in Indianapolis, USA; NBiS-2010 in Takayama, Japan; NBiS-2011 in Tirana, Albania; NBiS-2012 in Melbourne, Australia; NBiS-2013 in Gwangju Korea; and NBiS-2014 in Salerno, Italy.\nThis year NBiS-2015 will be held in Taipei, Taiwan.\n\nThe main objective of NBiS is to bring together researchers from both network systems and information systems with the aim of encouraging the exchange of ideas and experience between these two communities. It will represent an international forum to give an overview of the most recent trends. In the past decade, our network infrastructures have undergone radical changes. It has evolved from a small number of interconnected computer networks to a global socio-technical infrastructure, where people communicate and interact spontaneously in cyberspace and with the cyber physical world, create content and share knowledge over a network of heterogeneous networks. In the future, global society will increasingly rely on socio-technical networks designed in harmony with societal values and economic viability, with enhanced security, privacy, resilience, availability and manageability, and the ability to incorporate as yet unforeseen technologies, applications and services.",

To find how to deduce the learning style, we are investigating, in this paper, the relationships between the learner‟s navigation behaviour and his/her learning style in web-based learning. To explore this relation, we carried out an experiment with 27 students of computer science at the engineering school (ESI-Algeria). The students used a hypermedia course on an e-learning platform. The learners‟ navigation behaviour is evaluated using a navigation type indicator that we propose and calculate based on trace analysis. The findings are presented with regard to the learning styles measured using the Index of Learning Styles by (Felder and Solomon 1996). We conclude with a discussion of these results.",

Moreover, it helps online course designers to adapt the learning material in a way that guarantees individualized learning, and helps learners to acquire meta-cognitive knowledge. The goal of this research is to identify learners’ behaviors and learning styles automatically during training sessions, based on trace analysis. In this paper, we focus on the identification of learners’ behaviors through our system: Indicators for the Deduction of Learning Styles. We shall first present our trace analysis approach. Then, we shall propose a ‘navigation type’ indicator to analyze learners’ behaviors and we shall define a method for calculating it. To this end, we shall build a decision tree based on semantic assumptions and tests …",

The main goal of this research is to help teachers to perceive and interpret the learner's activities in elearning situations, by exploiting and analyzing the tracks and providing knowledge on the activities, that we call learning indicators. In this paper, we present our initial proposal to automatically determine the learners' learning style in web based learning from learning indicators. The advantage of this approach is that it allows having a dynamically updated value of the learning style provided by the interpretation of tracks on the learner's activities. Furthermore, we propose the modeling of the learning style as a classification of the styles models proposed in the literature that can be detected in such a context. Thus the approach is independent of a particular learning style model. It is implemented in IDLS, a track based …",

Therefore, it is always useful to recognize the state of knowledge and the navigation behaviour of a learner in order to evaluate customize and adapt the learning process. In this paper, we aim to make a semantic analysis of the learner’s navigation during his apprenticeship in hypermedia content. The main reason of this analysis is to identify the browsing behaviour of a learner with the current course. We assume that if the semantic distance between the domain concepts of the documents (or pages) that follow each other in the navigation of a learner is great, then this reflects the unstructured navigation behaviour and interprets that the learner is disoriented. This type of behaviour could be due to the poor organization of the content and the bad structuring of the course. Indeed, this analysis will allow to the tutor, to identify the disoriented learners and help them, and to the course author, to specify the causes to restructure and to deepen the analysis of the existing content and the navigation links between the parts of the course.",

This task may mean, in a FOAD process, to carry out the real part of a project manager, with project specifications, with regards to technical and economic parameters.  This gives way to so many functions, not common ones at all, for the traditional act of teaching.  In fact, a teacher is not supposed to be a technology expert that is to create simulations, control a programming language, etc. To palliate this problem, the development of contents must be made easy by the use of a creation tool.  We present, in this paper, an authoring system called TAALIM, which aim to facilitate the tasks allotted to the designer through a simple elaboration process model, as well as a generic model of interactive multi-media teaching contents.

Dans le cas de documents hypermédias, il est toujours utile de reconnaitre le comportement de navigation de l’apprenant avant de pouvoir évaluer, personnaliser et adapter le processus d’apprentissage. Dans ce papier, nous visons l’analyse sémantique de la navigation de l’apprenant durant son apprentissage dans des contenus hypermédias. La raison principale de cette analyse est d’identifier le comportement de navigation d’un apprenant avec le cours étudié. Nous partons de l’hypothèse que si la distance sémantique entre les concepts du domaine des documents (ou pages) qui se suivent dans la navigation d’un apprenant est grande, alors ceci traduit un comportement déstructuré dans la navigation de l’apprenant et interprète une désorientation de ce dernier. Ce type de comportement pourrait être dû soit au faible niveau de connaissances de l’apprenant et/ou à une mauvaise organisation et structuration du cours. En effet, cette analyse va permettre au tuteur de reconnaitre les apprenants désorientés et les aider, et à l’auteur du cours de restructurer et d’approfondir l’analyse des liens de navigation existants entre les parties du cours.",

The analysis of the semantic path of a learner or group of learners during the learning process can allow detecting those students who are in needs of help as well as identify the insufficiently mastered concepts. We examine the possibility of using a student’s browsing path during a learning session, based on his navigation traces, to update the learner model. We assume that the domain concepts examined outside the learning platform but that are related to the course concepts are problematic to the learner. Knowing about these concepts may allow the course’s author to adapt the course to the learner’s needs regarding these concepts, as well as allow the tutor to help and assist the learner on these problematic concepts. We rely on Web data mining methods to filter, organize, and analyze the …",

This radical change has influenced the students’ behavior, emotional state as well as their ability to learn. In order to analyze this situation, we focus in this work on the automatic detection of students’ emotions while exploiting the techniques and methods of sentiment analysis and machine learning. The proposed solution aims to predict students’ emotions and some of the aspects related to online learning from students’ reviews and then infers the attitude of students using association rules and clustering. The data-set consists of students’ answers in a forum sent at the end of sessions and semesters, annotated manually, during online learning. The obtained results using precision and recall was satisfying and favorable.",

In this article, SDLD (Structure Dialogue Learning Design) is presented, which is a semiformal EML that aims to improve controllability of learning design quality, one of the major concerns of practitioners that has not been previously addressed by EMLs. To address this problem, SDLD follows the proposals of Transactional Distance Theory (TDT). The adoption of this theory helps to measure, identify, and integrate the determinants of learning design quality in the creation of learning designs. Results from using SDLD showed that it improves the expressiveness of EMLs, especially in terms of the interactional facet of learning units and confirmed that it improves the usefulness of existing EMLs. In this context, SDLD represents …",

Dans cetarticle, nous nous situons au niveau de l’adaptation des scénarios d’apprentissage. Nous essayonsd’offrir à l’enseignant un moyen pour comparer le scénario prescrit avec celui réalisé. Notre approcheest basée sur la collecte d’informations durant la session d’apprentissage, sur le parcours del’apprenant. Ces informations seront structurées en indicateurs donnant à la fois une interprétation surle comportement de l’apprenant et ses résultats permettant à l’enseignant de revoir le contenu pourl’adapter aux apprenants.",

                "Description": "A current trend in software engineering is the model-driven software engineering approach, which emphasizes the use of formal models in the design phase to streamline the development process. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) has emerged as a widely adopted open-standard modeling approach. This paper introduces a Y-Design Formal Modeling Framework tailored for the efficient design and development of RESTful web service-based e-learning systems. Rooted in the 2-Track Unified Process (2TUP), the Y-Design framework structures the design process into three stages, each strategically employing selected UML diagrams: a functional stage focusing on capturing and modeling user requirements, a technical stage addressing architectural needs and defining system components, and a design-integration stage that harmonizes both tracks into a unified system. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework are validated through the implementation of a typical e-learning system, demonstrating its potential to streamline design while ensuring robust and scalable solutions for modern distributed systems. The proposed framework emphasizes agility and coherence, making it particularly suited for e-learning projects requiring modularity and efficient reuse of common e-learning users' required services.",

                "Description": "The development of e-learning platforms often focuses on designing system requirements, rather than users’ functional requirements, which negatively impacts user behavior, interaction, and overall e-learning experience. This research addresses that gap by proposing a user-centric web services architecture for e-learning systems. Our approach designs RESTful web services APIs to specific required and desired functionalities of various e-learning users including learners, tutors, teachers, and administrators. The effectiveness of this design approach is demonstrated through a comprehensive overview of the implementation process of an e-learning prototype built using the Django REST framework. The e-learning system's user experience was rigorously evaluated through well-known User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ). Evaluation results revealed high performance across all user experience dimensions, surpassing standard benchmarks, particularly in efficiency and attractiveness scales. This research demonstrates that the system’s user-centric design based on user-oriented web service can streamline the development processes of e-learning platforms while enhancing the system's attractiveness and the overall user experience.",

                "Description": "Upon natural or industrial disasters, the reliability and continuity of communications becomes an absolute priority to ensure the availability of critical services. In this context, network slicing emerges as a promising solution for isolating quality of service needs. In addition, URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication) services are essential to enable effective coordination for real-time emergency management and remote equipment control. The integration of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) as flying MECs (Multi-access Edge Computing) to provide the essential resources for network slicing in disaster scenarios has a substantial effect on the scope of emergency operations management. UAVs involvement facilitates extending connectivity to remote areas, where mobile infrastructure is unavailable. However, due to inefficient node selection for resource allocation, the number of satisfied slicing requests may …",

In addition, organizations need to make better decisions more quickly. Moreover, they need to change those decisions immediately to adapt to this increasingly dynamic business environment. It is primarily a question in ensuring the decisional aspect by adopting the SOA as a support architecture. In this paper, we describe a new approach called SOA based on a certain number of standards. It is going to be studied on three dimensions: The first is related to the definition of the information system implied in the SOA based on the use case model. The second develops the business dimension which is based on the BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation). The last dimension addresses the need of …",

It gave promising results when applied to many domains. However, analysts predict that most gamification systems are doomed to failure due to the lack of understanding of the gamification design process. Many attempts tried to propose design frameworks for gamification. Nevertheless, only few works were conducted to review the literature in this area of research. The present work is an attempt to review the literature for gamification design. It analyses and compares 28 candidate papers dealing with gamification design for generic application from different digital libraries. It results in a synthesis of the existing body of knowledge and identifies gaps that need to be completed.",

Cependant, de diverses difficultés se posent toujours, lors de la conception des SIE (Système d’Intelligence Economique). Ceci peut s’ expliquer par le manque de méthodes, car peu de travaux ont été réalisés dans le cadre méthodologique. Or, la plupart des écrits sur lesquelles nous nous reposons comme source d’information sont des constats des experts et rapport des hommes d’états, qui bien entendu, ignorent la dimension théorique du concept de l’IE.De ce fait, notre recherche s’ inscrit sur l’axe méthodologique pour la mise en œuvre de cette notion. Alors en nous basant sur l’exploitation de l’ingénierie des besoins pour l’amélioration de la phase «analyse des besoins» dans le cadre d’une une approche d’ingénierie des besoins pour la conception des SIE, nous présentons dans ce papier, un aperçu sur les méthodes déjà proposées pour la conception des SIE. Ensuite, en passant par la requalification d’un SIE à un système d’information d’IE (SI. IE), nous présenterons l’ingénierie des besoins dans les systèmes d’information, pour pouvoir la cerner en SI. IE. La suite de ce papier se focalisera sur la présentation d’une approche d’ingénierie des besoins pour la conception des SI. IE, en développant beaucoup plus l’aspect modélisation du besoin en IE. Nous terminerons notre papier avec une conclusion et perspectives.",

This is the workhorse of economic intelligence (EI). Our research work aims to produce an approach for identifying useful information for decision-maker who is often confronted with decisional situations on strategic level. The target of this paper is to show how the risks management contributes to acquisition of useful information for the strategic decision-making. This approach relies on a process by using four models (the model of strategic objectives, the model of the tree of strategic objectives, the model of useful information and model of risks). It also proposes a language of analysis and decomposition of strategic objectives. To evaluate our approach, we present a case study about the process of response to call for tender (RCT).

This chapter describes Service Oriented Architecture with decisional aspect (SOAda)                             . To define a new set of concepts necessary for modeling the three views: business, information and decision, a new meta-model called Decisional Model of Service (DMoS) will be presented. Some of these concepts are already known, whereas others are new and are proposed as an element of this chapter. The architecture leading elements are: the DMoS meta-model and the new …",

This usually means build, maintain and evolve an explicit representation of knowledge. The next step is to provide access to that knowledge, that is to say, the spread in order to enable effective use. Knowledge management in the medical field aims to improve the performance of the medical organization by allowing individuals in the care facility (doctors, nurses, paramedics, etc...) to capture, share and apply collective knowledge in order to make optimal decisions in real time. In this paper we propose a knowledge management approach based on integration technique of heterogeneous data in the medical field by creating a data warehouse, a technique of extracting knowledge from medical data by choosing a technique of data mining, and finally an exploitation technique of that knowledge in a case-based reasoning system.",

                "Description": "Decisions within the company, managers in countries or regions are made by one or more groups of decision-makers. The management of natural disasters involves several specialized decision-makers (experts, firefighters, police officers, drivers,). The aim of the chapter is to improve decision making in the context of natural disasters situation. Zero risk in the world does not exist due to natural phenomena that occur randomly and appear suddenly. It is essential to manage the risks in the situation of natural disasters and also to confront the influence of natural disasters on the phenomenon of Soil-Structure Interaction. For this, this chapter presents a conceptual architecture of a knowledge base to manage the risks of natural disasters remotely by a Geographic Information system (GIS) and embedded systems. This architecture is based on the integration of data via different sources of information (GIS, satellites, electronic sensors and comments from experts). To properly manage this information, this chapter uses the ontology of Soil-Structure Interaction With Agents External (OSSIWAE) in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT). A case study is conducted on a prototype of a model for building a structure threestory for testing the usability of the proposed architecture.",

These common error types aim to improve students' learning by helping teachers to take necessary corrective actions. Computing the most common error types is not obvious because of their taxonomic structure. Thus, using frequencies of error types leads to select the uppermost type as the most common one. For this reason, two other parameters are taken into account in addition to the type frequency: a type generality level and a number of type subtypes. To define a computing algorithm, the most common error types are formalised with three rules where each rule uses one parameter. The algorithm proposed is based on ranking function that respects the three rules. It assigns a score to an error type by multiplying its frequency with a weight function based on information …",

                "Description": "Various models and methods are used to support the design process of SOA (Service Oriented Architecture), but still after many years of practice, there are a lot of questions and unsolved problems that cause the failure of SOA development projects. One of the reasons is that rapid changes in the business environment make it necessary to introduce the decision design, which should be efectively supported by SOA. Indeed, it is a big challenge to create a system that help the human resource development in industry to make their work easier without missing an opportunity to get a best employee. The objective of this study is to develop a decision making and Service Oriented Architecture for employee recruitment using analytic hierarchy process. This study explored the relationship between SOA and decision making during the recruitment process. To achieve our goal, we use the new method SOA+ d to develop the SOA architecture. Also we provide the decision using the new standard Decision Model and Notation (DMN). The novelty of the proposed approach is in the a) the formal definition of a complete set of proposed services b) the uses of standards language and notation in each dimension of approach c) the specification of the mappings rules to identify a set of services. We illustrate the proposed approach with a real case study of the Recruitment and Selection in SAAD DAHLAB University.",

Parmi ces concepts on distingue la gestion de la mobilité qui est due à l’émergence des réseaux sans fil et la gestion de la qualité de service dans le but d’opérer de nouvelles applications sur ce réseau. Les premières solutions de la gestion de la mobilité consistaient seulement à maintenir la connexion du mobile pendant que celui-ci change de point d’attachement au réseau. Cette solution ne tient pas compte de la gestion de la qualité de service offerte par le réseau au nouveau point d’attachement. Dans un réseau mobile offrant une qualité de service, la durée nécessaire à l’accomplissement de la nouvelle connexion est importante, cependant, si le mobile doit s’ authentifier et si le réseau doit aussi installer la qualité de service à chaque changement de point d’attachement, la niveau de service se voit …",

Besides, we explore the most predictive features for each event. Our experiments on DBLP and Facebook datasets, using community structural features and its influential members' features, confirm that the prediction of the next event that may occur to an evolving community using change rates of features can be achieved with a very high accuracy. We further observe that the most significant features vary according to each event prediction.",

                "Description": "With its various real-life applications, predicting community evolution is a challenging task in the field of social network analysis. In this paper, we analyze communities’ evolution prediction accuracy in dynamic social networks. The proposed approach combines two key concepts of the process, aiming to enrich the prediction model by additional information that could improve the results:(1) a tailored network splitting that results in snapshots of different periods rather than a static one, and (2) the change rates of communities’ features that characterize them over time instead of absolute values of features. Our experiments on four realworld social networks confirm that community evolution prediction can be achieved with a very high accuracy by using both tailored network splitting as a first step of prediction process and change rates of features.",

Some models classify threats by type of attacks, others by specific attacks and other by using vulnerabilities and threat agent. Each model proposes a vision and a different approach to identify these threats. For example, to design security techniques for wireless biometric card, one should identify all threats facing this kind of device. In this paper, a comparative study and synthesis to help choose the most fitting model, depending on the security problems addressed, is given.",

In this paper, we make an experimental comparison between squares method and threshold methods. The experimental results show that the squares method is far better than methods based on threshold. But minutiae representation in squares method uses 2D representation while threshold methods are represented by composite representation. We proposed to implements squares methods using composite representation and made same experiments which showed less gain of time but more robustness and performance.",

                "Description": "Palmprint is one of the modalities that offer high recognition accuracy. The recognition process depends on an optimized ROI (Region of Interest) extraction. This extraction is affected by several factors including the device used and the acquisition conditions. The acquisition step can alter some image properties like rotation, translation and scale. Some devices are designed to maintain hand in a fixed position and delimit a subspace of the hand. On the other hand, contactless devices offer more convenience and flexibility but lead to altered images. ROI extraction methods must consider the acquisition device (with contact or contactless). In this paper, we propose palmprint recognition system considering this issue. A ROI extraction method is implemented and tested on different databases taking into account the acquisition device with different sensor conditions. Our research to test this method, are conducted on …",

The journal is embedded in the research and practice of professionals within the contemporary global context and its breadth and scope encourage debate on fundamental issues at all levels and from different research paradigms and learning theories.\n\nThe journal does not proselytize on behalf of the technologies (whether they be mobile, desktop, interactive, virtual, games-based or learning management systems) but rather provokes debate on all the complex relationships within and between computing and education, whether they are in informal or formal settings. It probes state of the art technologies in Computing Education and it also considers the design and evaluation of digital educational artefacts.",

Decisions on whether or not to publish a paper are subjective, but the minimum requirements are:\n\nThe paper must present original research, clearly demonstrating its novelty beyond that of previously published work.\nThe results must be significant and likely to make an important contribution to the advancement of their field.\nThe paper must be clearly presented, written in good scientific English, and conform to journal guidelines for content and presentation (see section 2).\nThe subject must be of interest to readers of MNRAS and fall within the range of topics covered by the journal.\nMNRAS publishes the results of original research in astronomy and astrophysics, including work which is observational, theoretical or concerned with astronomical instrumentation and software. Assessment of whether papers fall within this scope is made by the members of the editorial board, who will reject papers which are not on suitable topics.",

Medical image segmentation is thus an important process in image processing used to partition the images into different regions (eg gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)). Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) Model and Gibbs distributions provide powerful tools for image modeling. In this paper, we use a HMRF model to perform segmentation of volumetric medical images. We have a problem with incomplete data. We seek the segmented images according to the MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) criterion. MAP estimation leads to the minimization of an energy function. This problem is computationally intractable. Therefore, optimizations techniques are used to compute a solution. We will evaluate the segmentation upon two major factors: the time of calculation and the quality of segmentation. Processing time is reduced by distributing the computation of segmentation on a powerful and inexpensive architecture that consists of a cluster of personal computers. Parallel programming was done by using the standard MPI (Message Passing Interface).",

Elle fournit donc au praticien une aide à la décision pour effectuer son diagnostic. La pertinence de cet outil repose principalement sur la qualité de segmentation. Diverses techniques ont été proposées pour répondre au mieux à cette problématique. L'appréciation visuelle, même si elle indicative, ne garantit pas la supériorité d'une méthode par rapport à une autre. Des critères objectifs sont communément utilisés pour comparer les diverses techniques sur des images dont la segmentation est connue a priori.Du fait de l'inexistence d’une méthode universelle de segmentation, l'objectif de nos travaux est de fournir une méthode de segmentation très efficace en termes de qualité de segmentation. Dans nos travaux, nous avons utilisé la modélisation par champs aléatoires de Markov cachés HMRF (Hidden Markov Random Fields) pour poser le problème de la segmentation des images. Cette modélisation robuste et\" élégante\" aboutit à l’optimisation d’une fonction objectif. Une méthode d'optimisation s' impose donc pour obtenir la segmentation finale. Nous avons utilisé diverses techniques d’optimisation que sont le Recuit Simulé, la méthode des modes conditionnels itérés ICM (Iterated Conditional Modes), la méthode de Nelder-Mead, la méthode de Torczon, la méthode de BFGS et la méthode des essaims particulaires PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization). Nous avons proposé les combinaisons HMRF-ICM, HMRF-Nelder-Mead, HMRF-Torczon, HMRF-PSO et …",

Notre objectif est de développer une méthodologie qui doit être à la fois assez précise et assez simple pour les nécessités de déploiements à grande échelle que l'utilisation croissante de la vidéo sur IP est susceptible d'exiger. A cette fin, nous nous concentrerons sur l'élaboration d'une approche qui est capable d’analyser les statistiques du réseau et d’en trouver les corrélations, par exemple, la perte de paquets (disponible à partir de mesures simples) à la qualité de la vidéo séquence reconstruite par les récepteurs. Une étape dans cette direction est un modèle de la perte de distorsion qui tient compte de l'impact des pertes du réseau sur la qualité vidéo. Ce modèle doit tenir compte de paramètres spécifiques à l'application tels que le codec vidéo, la technique de …",

It has five (5) key areas within its scope with several subdivisions within each area. These areas are: (1) Power Engineering Education, (2) Power System Analysis, Computing, and Economics, (3) Power System Dynamic Performance, (4) Power System Operations, and (5) Power System Planning and Implementation. The purviews of these areas are broad and do not need frequent updates. However, if a new technology evolves in the industry and it needs specific focus, the purview of the corresponding area is updated to include the technology and the IEEE Transactions on Power Systems identifies it as a new subdivision.",

More and more domains of the daily life take advantage of the available tools (medicine, trade, meteorology…). However, such tools are confronted to a particular problem: the great number of characteristics that qualify data samples. They are more or less victims of the abundance of information.Sat domain benefits from the appearance of powerful solvers that can process huge amounts of data in short times. This paper presents an approach for translating timetable problems (which are a particular case of DSS), into a Boolean formula, which is then provided to an environment that allows experimenting different heuristics in order to extract solutions that satisfy a maximum number of clauses (Max-Sat problem). Finally, the best solutions are back-translated into the original problem in order to find an adequate schedule that satisfies the characteristics and constraints of the timetable problem.",

As a result, the substance of Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) problems and solutions have changed. Various data collection methods have also become possible through advanced technologies like IoT and wearable devices. Managing the big data produced by these multiple sources is now necessary. Many works introduced Big data-based solutions to deal with increasing data volume. However, spatial data were not explicitly considered in such solutions. The main objective of this paper is to highlight the need to integrate the spatial dimension into individual and continuous occupational risk exposure monitoring. To this end, we present a typical architecture of an integrated system taking advantage of the technological levers introduced by the Industry 4.0 phenomenon (IoT and spatial Big Data technologies).

Occupational Risk Management Process, is characterized by multiple types of data (activity sector, occupations, risks exposures, diseases, etc.). This multidimensional aspect of data strengthens the need for appropriate tools to enhance OH analysis. This paper examines the opportunity of using spatial data warehousing technique in the OH management framework to integrate various data formats such as geographic (workplace data) and thematic data which are usually scattered across multiple, dispersed and fragmented systems. We propose a SOLAP architecture that supports the whole process of risk management for prevention purposes. We then instantiate the architecture to build a SOLAP-Based System for SMT Company to enhance risk assessment in OH for electrical and gas industries.",

                "Description": "The main project for National Aures Observatory (NAO) is the construction of a Meta-Telescope consisting of several robotic and ultra-rapid telescopes. This telescope'farm'will face hundreds of observation requests that have to be scheduled. The goal of this work is to compute the best schedule for all observations, over all night and using all available telescopes. The scheduler must also take into account all the interruptions that may randomly occur during the observation process, especially those relative to Gravitational Waves and Gamma-Ray Bursts alerts, which are the main goal of the Aures Observatory. To solve this multi-objectives optimization problem, we proposed a scheduler of a predictive class. A genetic algorithm approach was used to compute the solution of the scheduling problem based on NSGA-II and using Pareto Optimality.",

Agents, which may represent any entities that act in production, negotiate to find best schedules. In this paper, we present a new multi-agent scheduling method that integrates both planning and maintenance activities. Actually, more than one plan can be generated for a job production. We suppose that plan selection must depend on information about machines maintenance and states to offer realistic schedules. Tests demonstrate that despite increasing time resolution with the agents’ number, our system is scalable with reduced Cmax and machines failure risk.",

Deterministic methods are incapable of applicable solutions from the moment that they assume that the data of the problem are perfectly known and unchangeable.Les solutions proposées dans le domaine des ordonnancements conjoints de production et de maintenance considèrent les deux types d'activités (production et maintenance) de la même façon alors qu’elles n’ont pas les mêmes contraintes. En effet, la planification de la maintenance ne dépend pas seulement de l’état des machines. Elle dépend aussi de la disponibilité, de la compétence et de la performance de la ressource humaine qui va l’exécuter puisque la plupart des activités de maintenance se font manuellement. De ce fait, le temps opératoire d’une activité de maintenance ne peut être fixé que lorsque si la ressource humaine qui va l’exécuter est déterminée. Les ateliers de production sont sujets à l’apparition d’événements perturbateurs pouvant rendre les données initiales des ordonnancements obsolètes. Les méthodes déterministes sont incapables des solutions applicables à partir du moment qu’ils supposent que les données du problème sont parfaitement connues et inchangeables.",

It is applied for both production and joint production and maintenance scheduling as well. ETOMA architecture is composed of three modules: Develop, Test and Blackboard. The first one defines all agents that model the floor shop and their behavior. The second one takes care of testing the scheduling solution by using Taillard benchmarks depending on floor shop types. The considered types are Flow-shop, Job-shop and Open-shop. Finally, the Blackboard insures communication between the two predefined modules. ETOMA allows developing and testing any scheduling solution without imposing a specific architecture for agents. Moreover, ETOMA provides at the end of simulations a report composed of a recapitulative table or a curve according to user choice.",

Cette hypothèse n’est pourtant pas fidèle à la réalité des ateliers de production. Cet article présente une nouvelle approche proactive-réactive pour la résolution du problème de l’ordonnancement conjoint de la production et la maintenance sur une machine. L’approche proposée prend en compte les incertitudes des données du problème. Ces incertitudes peuvent être des imprécisions relatives aux estimations des durées opératoires des tâches ou bien des incertitudes concernant l’apparition ou non d’événements pouvant affecter le déroulement du processus de production. Pour modéliser l’imprécision, nous utilisons la logique floue et pour traiter les différents événements nous utilisons l’approche par scénarios. La méthode proposée consiste en deux phases : (1) une phase proactive dans laquelle un ordonnancement sous incertitudes de base est généré   (2) une phase réactive pour la prise en compte des événements temps réels en vue d’adapter l’ordonnancement de base aux nouvelles données. Nous utilisons la technologie agent comme support de modélisation de l'atelier de production\"",

The current advances in computing, networking technology and software have spurred a lot of research interest in cluster and internet computing, as demonstrated in Cloud and Grid computing, and distributed high performance data centers.\n\nIn the last few years, we have seen an increased interest in developing applications, software tools, communications protocols and high performance data centers, Grids and cloud computing sites to capitalize on these advances and initiatives. Publications about these developments currently appear in several journals that either focus on the communications field, or on parallel and distributed computing with a strong emphasis on the parallel algorithms. Cluster Computing Journal will uniquely address the latest results in integrating these three fields to support the development of high performance parallel distributed computing systems and their applications. The journal will be an important source of information for the growing number of researchers, developers and users of High Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing environments. In these environments, parallel and/or distributed computing techniques are applied to the solution of large-scale scientific and engineering applications running on clusters, cloud computing and/or distributed data centers.",

Significant experimental, numerical or theoretical contributions advancing the understanding of plastic behaviour of solids are of special interest, together with studies relating macroscopic to the microscopic behaviour of solids. Papers on modeling of finite nonlinear elastic deformation, with similarities to modeling of plastic deformation, are also welcome.\n\nThe Journal will contain research papers, review articles, research notes, letters to the editor, and academic advertisements (books, journals, conferences, and symposia). Strain-rate dependent and strain-rate independent constitutive models to predict observed phemonena during quasi-static, dynamic or cyclic thermo-mechanical loading, behaviour of granular or porous solids under high confining pressures and at high temperatures, multiscale modeling of various deformation mechanisms (dislocation, twinning, and phase transformation), and models with capability for predicting the behaviour of composite materials based onknown plastic behaviour of matrix and fibers in such materials, are some examples of the main themes of this journal. Revealing applications of the new models of plasticity, including modelling of the observed phenomena in metal forming processes are also of interest.",

                "Description": "Gliomas are the most common primary brain malignancies, with different degrees of aggressiveness, variable prognosis and various heterogeneous histologic sub-regions, i.e., peritumoral edematous/invaded tissue, necrotic core, active and non-enhancing core. This intrinsic heterogeneity is also portrayed in their radio-phenotype, as their sub-regions are depicted by varying intensity profiles disseminated across multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) scans, reflecting varying biological properties. Their heterogeneous shape, extent, and location are some of the factors that make these tumors difficult to resect, and in some cases inoperable. The amount of resected tumor is a factor also considered in longitudinal scans, when evaluating the apparent tumor for potential diagnosis of progression. Furthermore, there is mounting evidence that accurate segmentation of the various tumor sub-regions can offer the basis for quantitative image analysis towards prediction of patient overall survival. This study assesses the state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) methods used for brain tumor image analysis in mpMRI scans, during the last seven instances of the International Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge, i.e., 2012-2018. Specifically, we focus on i) evaluating segmentations of the various glioma sub-regions in pre-operative mpMRI scans, ii) assessing potential tumor progression by virtue of longitudinal growth of tumor sub-regions, beyond use of the RECIST/RANO criteria, and iii) predicting the overall survival from pre-operative mpMRI scans of patients that underwent gross total resection. Finally, we investigate the …",

The proposed method is based on a hybrid approach that relies on a brain symmetry analysis method and a combining region‐based and boundary‐based segmentation methods. The segmentation process consists of three main stages. In the first one, image pre‐processing is applied to remove any noise, and to extract the brain from the head image. In the second stage, automated tumour detection is performed. It is based essentially on FBB method using brain symmetry. The obtained result constitutes the automatic initialisation of a deformable model, thus removing the need of selecting the initial region of interest by the user. Finally, the third stage focuses on the application of region growing combined with 3D deformable model based on …",

In this paper a 3D computerized facial reconstruction method from 3D-MRI of human heads is presented. It based on a model deformable approach constrained by the knowledge of soft tissues thicknesses, at a certain number of characteristic landmarks. The facial reconstruction process is divided into two main stages. An automatic initialization step of the deformable model is based on a non-linear registration technique guided by B-Spline Free-Form Deformations (FFD) model. In the second step, the initial skin, resulting from the transformation computed previously, is refined by means of a 3D deform-able model based on simplexes meshes that is attracted by some characteristic landmarks previously computed by a calculation of Mean and Gaussian curvatures.

It is based on a reference 3D image from which skull and skin are extracted, and an image of the skull of the unknown head for which the skin should be reconstructed. The facial reconstruction is obtained by deforming the 3D image of the reference skull to the one of the unknown skull. This transformation is based on a non‐linear registration method guided by B‐splines Free‐Form Deformations (FFD). Then, the same deformation is applied to transform the reference skin to obtain a new skin that we consider near the unknown skin. This method has been evaluated on sets of skull/skin data, extracted from 3D‐MRI of individual heads having similar anthropological features.",

                "Description": "Facial reconstruction from a cranial skeleton is an important technique in several scientific areas, especially in forensic sciences, archaeology, and palaeontology. It is used for skull identification and recognition of people. It can be classified, among reconstructive identification methods. It is most often used as a last resort, when all other techniques fail to produce a person presumed identity. This thesis addresses the facial reconstruction problem from three-dimensional (3D) images of human skulls, considered as unknown. We present a 3D computerized facial reconstruction method based on recent techniques of medical imaging, where the main objectives are the processing speed and the elimination of the subjectivity by leaning particularly on mathematical criteria for evaluating the results. Our method is based on a model deformable approach constrained by the knowledge of soft tissues thicknesses, at a certain number of characteristic landmarks. It uses, for each facial reconstruction, a 3D image of a reference head from which skull and skin are extracted, and a 3D image of the skull of the unknown head for which the skin should be reconstructed. The facial reconstruction process is divided into two main stages. An initialization step of the deformable model, based on a non-linear registration technique guided by B-Spline Free-Form Deformations (FFD) model. We therefore, propose an automatic initialization that is achieved only from a reference skull and skin set as well as an unknown skull. At first, a transformation of the reference skull image into the unknown skull image is computed. Then, we apply the same transformation to deform the …",

Cet article présente une méthode de reconstruction faciale fondée sur des techniques récentes d’imagerie médicale. La reconstruction faciale est obtenue en déformant l’image 3D du crâne de référence vers celle du crâne qualifié d’inconnu. Cette transformation s’ appuie sur un recalage 3D non linéaire guidé par un modèle de déformations de forme libre (FFD) à base de B-splines. Ensuite, la même déformation est appliquée pour transformer la peau de référence vers une nouvelle peau que nous considérons proche de la peau inconnue. Cette méthode a été évaluée à partir de deux ensembles de données crâne/peau correspondant à une tête de référence et à une tête dont la peau est à reconstruire issus d’IRM-3D de têtes d’individus ayant des caractéristiques anthropologiques similaires.Facial reconstruction from a cranial skeleton has emerged as an increasingly important tool in archaeology as well in forensic sciences for identification of people.

Non-traditional topics are especially encouraged. The importance of cross-cutting research continues to grow as we grapple with the end of Dennard scaling, the explosion of big data, scales ranging from ultra-low power wearable devices to exascale parallel and cloud computers, the need for sustainability, and increasingly human-centered applications. ASPLOS embraces systems research that directly target new problems in innovative ways. The research may target diverse goals, such as performance, energy and thermal efficiency, resiliency, security, sustainability, applicability to future technologies, applications, and environments. The review process will be sensitive to the challenges of multidisciplinary work in emerging areas.",

Taken as a whole, Archimedes will be of interest to historians, philosophers, and scientists, as well as to those in business and industry who seek to understand how science and industry have come to be so strongly linked.",

These techniques refer to three complementary abstraction levels: algorithms, circuits, and layout. The authors deal with pseudo-random testing and present a method of condensing test points based on the notion of fault sector. Based on a set of proposed heuristics, a tool for automatically inserting test points was developed. Experimental results obtained with the tool are presented to indicate that excellent pseudo-random testability can be achieved with few test points. This technique leads to the lowest reported number of test points while significantly reducing the number of random patterns which are required to achieve very close to 100% fault coverage.<>",

Thus, the cost of manual annotating the data will be less, and the process of learning can be accelerated. Most of the studies on applying active learning methods to automatic text classification focused on requesting the label of a single unlabeled document in each iteration. Unlike English, There are very few researches done in this area for the Arabic text. In this paper, we present a novel active learning method for Arabic text classification using multi-class SVM. The proposed method selects a batch of informative samples for manually labeling by an expert. The experimental results show that employing our method can significantly reduce the need for labeled training data.",

It is a low-level processing task which consists in partitioning an image into homogeneous regions. Segmentation can be seen as a combinatorial optimization problem. In fact, considering the huge amount of information that an image carries, it is impossible to find the best segmentation. On the other hand, the reduced individual properties of ants as well as the simplicity of their behaviours led to the design of several methods of optimization by ants such as: optimization by colony of ants (ant colony optimization) and classification by co-operating ants (AntClass, AntTree, AntClust...). In this paper, we present an algorithm for the resolution of the segmentation problem. This algorithm, named ISA (image segmentation using ants), is based on the behavior of ants while cleaning their nest. The image to be segmented represents the …",

Cet article présente un environnement nommé PARME, basé sur une architecture parallèle, permettant d'implanter différentes approches pour résoudre le problème Max-Sat. Il offre à l'utilisateur un moyen efficace pour étudier les méthode de résolution des problèmes NB-Complets. L'utilisateur peut pratiquer de manière empirique différentes approches d'optimisation (Recherche Tabou, Algorithmes Génétiques, GSAT,...), évaluer leurs performances et étudier l'importance et l'influence des paramètres de la méthode sur son comportement. Afin de bénéficier des avantages des qualités de chaque méthode et de surmonter ses inconvénients, de nombreuses méthodes peuvent collaborer dans PARME, à la recherche de la solution du problème.",

This platform is independent from the physical architecture of nodes, where each node is considered as an autonomous agent having its own properties and behaviors according to the role it takes in the network. Once the description of the WSN is done using agent models, we can translate them to the simulation environment or directly to the physical network architecture using a translation library witch makes the correspondence between agent models and the target environment. To validate our work, we have extended OMNeT++ with new models for WSN and implemented some functions that translate automatically the agent models of the WSN nodes to OMNeT++ source code.",

                "Description": "Decision Support Systems (DSS) are a constantly growing area. More and more domains of the daily life take advantage of the available tools (medicine, trade, meteorology…). However, such tools are confronted to a particular problem: the great number of characteristics that qualify data samples. They are more or less victims of the abundance of information.Sat domain benefits from the appearance of powerful solvers that can process huge amounts of data in short times. This paper presents an approach for translating timetable problems (which are a particular case of DSS), into a Boolean formula, which is then provided to an environment that allows experimenting different heuristics in order to extract solutions that satisfy a maximum number of clauses (Max-Sat problem). Finally, the best solutions are back-translated into the original problem in order to find an adequate schedule that satisfies the characteristics and constraints of the timetable problem.",

It is an NP-Complete problem that deals with the different constraints relative to the system and the underlying target architecture. The existing partitioning approaches have a major drawback: they are generally dedicated to particular classes of applications and/or target architectures and this makes them difficult to generalize as soon as small changes are performed on the system under design. Besides, it is generally difficult to include new strategies that might be better suited to the applications to partition. This paper introduces a parallel environment that offers the user the opportunity to describe, experiment new heuristics and test different sets of parameters. It is also possible to explore new hybridization schemes between different strategies.",

In real application scenarios, the collection of training (labeled) samples to design a classifier is not always trivial due to the complexity and the cost which characterize the process. A possible solution to this issue can be found in the exploitation of the large number of unlabeled samples which are accessible at zero cost from the web. Active learning strives to reduce the required labeling effort while retaining the accuracy by intelligently selecting the samples to be labeled. This Study presents a novel active learning method for text classification that selects a batch of informative samples for manual labeling by an expert. The proposed method uses the posterior probability output of a multi-class SVM method. The experiments are performed with two well-known datasets and the presented …",

                "Description": "Palmprint is one of the modalities that offer high recognition accuracy. The recognition process depends on an optimized ROI (Region of Interest) extraction. This extraction is affected by several factors including the device used and the acquisition conditions. The acquisition step can alter some image properties like rotation, translation and scale. Some devices are designed to maintain hand in a fixed position and delimit a subspace of the hand. On the other hand, contactless devices offer more convenience and flexibility but lead to altered images. ROI extraction methods must consider the acquisition device (with contact or contactless). In this paper, we propose palmprint recognition system considering this issue. A ROI extraction method is implemented and tested on different databases taking into account the acquisition device with different sensor conditions. Our research to test this method, are conducted on …",

                "Description": "The central focus of this work is the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), a machine learning model widely used for density estimation and cluster analysis. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is commonly used to train GMMs. One of the main challenges facing this algorithm under the shift towards embedded systems is the crippling memory constraints. Indeed, the EM is an iterative algorithm that requires several scans of the data, thus several I/O opeartions. Hence, when the dataset cannot be fully stored in the main memory, its execution is slowed down by the huge data movements (I/Os) between the main memory and the secondary storage. In this work, we present an I/O optimization of the EM algorithm for GMMs that relies on two main contributions: (1) a divide-and-conquer strategy that divides the dataset into chunks, learns the GMM separately in each chunk and combines the results incrementally; (2) a strategy that restricts the training of the GMM on a subset of data while producing a sufficiently good accuracy, by utilizing the information learned from the first chunk.",

                "Description": "This paper presents three approaches for the implementation of Optimal Ate pairing based on Jacobean coordinates, over Barreto-Naehrig curves, targeting the 128 bits security level, in Genesys board. The first approach is a fully software implementation using MicroBlaze processor. The second approach is software/hardware implementation, in which the most useful operations in\\({\\varvec {F}} _ {\\varvec {p}}\\) and\\({\\varvec {F}} _ {{\\varvec {p}}^{2}}\\) are coded as intellectual property cores around the Microblaze. The third approach is based on the second in which we exploit the parallelism that exists to compute Optimal Ate pairing. The integration of multi-MicroBlaze processor in single architecture allows not only the flexibility of the overall system but also the parallelism to speed up pairing. Various techniques and parameters are used and combined to compute Optimal Ate in efficient way, namely: Montgomery modular multiplication, Karatsuba method, Jacobean coordinate, Complex method for squaring, Sparse multiplication, squaring in the cyclotomic subgroup\\({\\varvec {G}} _ {\\varvec {\\varphi} 6}\\left ({\\varvec {F}} _ {{\\varvec {p}}^{12}}\\right)\\) and addition chain method. Our flexible and parallel systems are dedicated for restricted environment resources with a reasonable execution time.",

                "Description": "Les accélérateurs matériels ont été depuis longtemps utilisés pour booster les performances dans les MPSoC. Cependant, ces derniers introduisent un surplus d’occupation de surface sur ces systèmes. Le travail présenté dans cet article présente un outil pour trouver un compromis entre l’accélération apportée par ces accélérateurs matériels et la surface occupée par ces derniers. Pour ce faire, nous proposons d’utiliser un nouveau type d’architectures basé sur le partage d’accélérateurs matériels. Nous présentons une approche d’exploration de l’espace de conception (ou DSE pour Design Space Exploration) basée sur un algorithme génétique hybridé à un nouveau type de recherche locale (PVNS), pour l’exploration bi-objectif de l’espace de conception, dans les architectures à base de partage d’accélérateurs matériels. L’approche proposée a été testée sur trois applications: le Multiple Target Tracking (MTT), le JPEG et une application synthétique. Notre algorithme apporte un gain en temps d’exploration pouvant atteindre les 99.86% par rapport aux travaux existants basés sur un modèle mixte de programmation linéaire en nombres entiers (MILP), tout en y ajoutant la considération de la contrainte d’accélération. Cette approche permet une réduction de la surface occupée par les accélérateurs pouvant atteindre les 81, 48%, par rapport à une implémentation sans partage d’accélérateurs.",

Dans CODOO, un système est spécifié en utilisant le langage C étendu par une librairie temps réel pour pouvoir exprimer les contraintes temporelles. Une fois le système spécifié, un partitionnement interactif est effectué permettant de distinguer les trois parties du système: le hardware (les ASICs), le software (le programme) et l interface entre les deux. Le processus de partitionnement commence par la construction du graphe de communication inters objets. Ce dernier est ensuite affiché à l écran pour permettre au concepteur de sélectionner les objets à implémenter en hardware. Le choix du concepteur est guidé par un certain nombre d informations de synthèse fournies par le graphe comme le taux de communication, la taille des objets, etc. Une fois le partitionnement effectué, le code C de la …",

This work uses this technique to model the vocal tract using a one dimensional transmission line. A six port scattering node is applied in the region separating the pharyngeal, oral and the nasal part of the vocal tract.",

                "Description": "Medical imaging applications produce large sets of similar images. The huge amount of data makes the manual analysis and interpretation a fastidious task. Medical image segmentation is thus an important process in image processing used to partition the images into different regions (eg gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)). Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) Model and Gibbs distributions provide powerful tools for image modeling. In this paper, we use a HMRF model to perform segmentation of volumetric medical images. We have a problem with incomplete data. We seek the segmented images according to the MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) criterion. MAP estimation leads to the minimization of an energy function. This problem is computationally intractable. Therefore, optimizations techniques are used to compute a solution. We will evaluate the segmentation upon two major factors: the time of calculation and the quality of segmentation. Processing time is reduced by distributing the computation of segmentation on a powerful and inexpensive architecture that consists of a cluster of personal computers. Parallel programming was done by using the standard MPI (Message Passing Interface).",

Several methods have been developed to perform segmentation. We present a method that combines Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) and Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) to perform segmentation. HMRF is used for modelling the segmentation problem. This elegant model leads to an optimization problem. The latter is solved using PSO method whose parameters setting is a task in itself. We conduct a study for the choice of parameters that give a good segmentation. The quality of segmentation is evaluated on grounds truths images using Misclassification Error criterion. We use the NDT (Non Destructive Testing) image dataset to evaluate several segmentation methods. These results show a supremacy of the HMRF-PSO method over threshold based techniques.",

                "Description": "Medical imaging applications produce large sets of similar images. The huge amount of data makes the manual analysis and interpretation a fastidious task. Medical image segmentation is thus an important process in image processing used to partition the images into different regions (eg gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid). Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) Model and Gibbs distributions provide powerful tools for image modeling. In this paper, we use a HMRF model to perform segmentation of volumetric medical images. We have a problem with incomplete data. We seek the segmented images according to the MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) criterion. MAP estimation leads to the minimization of an energy function. This problem is computationally intractable. Therefore, optimizations techniques are used to compute a solution. We will evaluate the segmentation upon two major factors: the time of calculation and the quality of segmentation. Processing time is reduced by distributing the computation of segmentation on a powerful and inexpensive architecture that consists of a cluster of personal computers. Parallel programming was done by using the standard MPI (Message Passing Interface).",

D’où la nécessité des systèmes automatiques de segmentation médicale, une tâche cruciale qui consiste à diviser une image numérique en plusieurs segments dont le but est de simplifier et de changer sa représentation en quelque chose de plus significatif et plus facile à analyser par l’humain, afin d’apporter une aide permettant au praticien de poser le diagnostic le plus adéquat.",

Segmentation is one of key operations to provide a decision support to physicians. There are several methods to perform segmentation. We use Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) for modelling the segmentation problem. This elegant model leads to an optimization problem. Particles Swarm Optimization (PSO) method is used to achieve brain magnetic resonance image segmentation. Setting the parameters of the HMRF-PSO method is a task in itself. We conduct a study for the choice of parameters that give a good segmentation. The segmentation quality is evaluated on ground-truth images, using the Dice coefficient also called Kappa index. The results show a superiority of the HMRF-PSO method, compared to methods such as Classical MRF and MRF using variants of ACO (Ant Colony Optimization).",

In this paper we present a general purpose image mosaicking system, named EsiReg. We will focus on some aspects of EsiReg mainly video mosaicking and panoramic views creation. We will rely on a feature-point stitching approach to perform the registration of images. A robust algorithm is used to extract the features points in the images. To have a smooth resulting image, seamless blending methods are also implemented. Performing a mosaicking operation is not sufficient to claim reaching the goal. We have used objective metrics to evaluate the mosaic and confront the results to comparable systems.",

Its mission is to publish high impact articles contributing to the field of data and information quality (IQ). IQ covers a wide range of dimensions including accuracy and completeness, provenance, lineage and trust, understandability and accessibility. Research contributions can range from modeling and measurement of quality, to improvement of quality with data cleansing methods, to organizational management of quality, to evaluations of quality in real scenarios.\n\nGiven the diversity of disciplines and author interests, we also welcome experience papers, typically submitted by a practitioner or industrial researcher who has a compelling application, interesting dataset or valuable teaching tool, to share with our readers. Finally, we are accepting two-page vision papers that describe a major research challenge to the JDIQ community.",

The Skyline is used to reduce the search space and focusing only on interesting web services that are not dominated by any other service. AHP is used to weight QoS criteria in a simple and an intuitive manner; it allows for checking whether the weights assigned are consistent. Promethee method is leveraged to rank skyline services, by taking advantage of the outranking relationships between skyline candidate services and generating positive, negative and Net flows. An algorithm is proposed to rank skyline services based on Net flow. A case study based on an example of QoS dataset is presented to illustrate the different steps of our approach. The experimental evaluation conducted on real Dataset demonstrates that our approach can better capture …",

To deal with the large number of candidates, Skyline method is used frequently to find the most pertinent Web services that are not dominated by any other service; whenever, i) the number of Skyline Web Services cannot be controlled. ii) Skyline doesn't allow assigning importance weights to QoS attributes. In this paper we propose an efficient framework to handle the above drawbacks. K-representative Skyline is used to reduce the research space giving users a summary about the full Skyline Web Services. For weighting QoS attributes we propose an enhanced version of Fuzzy AHP method based on natural language and asking fewer efforts to users. To Rank-order pertinent Skyline Web …",

It gave promising results when applied to many domains. However, analysts predict that most gamification systems are doomed to failure due to the lack of understanding of the gamification design process. Many attempts tried to propose design frameworks for gamification. Nevertheless, only few works were conducted to review the literature in this area of research. The present work is an attempt to review the literature for gamification design. It analyses and compares 28 candidate papers dealing with gamification design for generic application from different digital libraries. It results in a synthesis of the existing body of knowledge and identifies gaps that need to be completed.",

CI enables the development of strategies that confer companies a significant competitive advantage. The appropriate decisions are taken when all required data are considered. As the amount of data grows very fast inside and outside of an enterprise, exploiting these mountains of data efficiently became a crucial need. Note that such data are usually multiples, heterogeneous, autonomous and distributed. The main issue is related to the identification and resolution of structural and semantic heterogeneity between data, usually spread in multiple sources. Data integration is a significant solution that addresses these problems. Data Warehouse (DW) is viewed as Data Integration System (DIS) that consolidates several data sources in the …",

Economic intelligence actors collaborate to solve a decisional problem, they use significant mental effort, and so they share a common knowledge that can indicate to other actors directions to follow or avoid. Indeed, whenever an actor explores knowledge or a relevant document, it enriches the collective knowledge of the memory via annotations. To ensure this collaboration in solving a decisional problem among actors in a context of economic intelligence, in this article we propose a conceptual model using ontologies to represent collaborative semantic annotations between economic intelligence actors in order to capitalise on and reuse the knowledge shared in a collective memory.",

More and more domains of the daily life take advantage of the available tools (medicine, trade, meteorology…). However, such tools are confronted to a particular problem: the great number of characteristics that qualify data samples. They are more or less victims of the abundance of information.Sat domain benefits from the appearance of powerful solvers that can process huge amounts of data in short times. This paper presents an approach for translating timetable problems (which are a particular case of DSS), into a Boolean formula, which is then provided to an environment that allows experimenting different heuristics in order to extract solutions that satisfy a maximum number of clauses (Max-Sat problem). Finally, the best solutions are back-translated into the original problem in order to find an adequate schedule that satisfies the characteristics and constraints of the timetable problem.",

This usually means build, maintain and evolve an explicit representation of knowledge. The next step is to provide access to that knowledge, that is to say, the spread in order to enable effective use. Knowledge management in the medical field aims to improve the performance of the medical organization by allowing individuals in the care facility (doctors, nurses, paramedics, etc...) to capture, share and apply collective knowledge in order to make optimal decisions in real time. In this paper we propose a knowledge management approach based on integration technique of heterogeneous data in the medical field by creating a data warehouse, a technique of extracting knowledge from medical data by choosing a technique of data mining, and finally an exploitation technique of that knowledge in a case-based reasoning system.",

                "Description": "Over the years data cleaning solutions have focused on modifying data in order to satisfy a set of integrity constraints (ICs). However, constraints may also be erroneous. Consequently, when dealing with an inconsistency, it becomes difficult to determine whether the data is dirty, the ICs or both. In this paper, we address three main challenges:(1) Uncertainty: Since both data and ICs could be dirty, it is difficult to detect the source of the inconsistency and how to repair it. We propose a new metric to evaluate the relevance degree of ICs (Functional Dependencies (FDs)).(2) ICs Accuracy: when repairing ICs, they could be transformed to overrefined ICs preventing errors detection or oversimplified ICs leading to clean data modification. We propose to extract possible FD repairs from association rules with limiting the number of LHS attributes to avoid overrefined FDs. Oversimplified FDs on the other hand, are avoided by allowing FD repairs only when the candidate is close enough to the FD.(3) Data Accuracy: Most existing solutions repairing both data and constraints, focus more on the simultaneous repair and less on the data repair algorithm, which affects the quality of the data updates. We propose to use CSP-DC which updates data when possible, and handles ambiguous repair cases by formulating the data cleaning problem as a constraint satisfaction problem, allowing all repairs to be consistent. Experiments show that our solution outperforms most renowned state-of-the-art approaches and provides accurate constraints and data repairs in a linear time.",

Its main goal is to allow decision-makers to, efficiently, access datasets in OLAP system anywhere and anytime. The challenge of this work is to be able to improve decisional performances while overcoming capability context. To achieve this goal, the framework integrates in a systematic, generic and extensible way, knowledge in the context-aware recommender process, on one hand. On the other hand, it proposes contextual recommendations. For that purpose, the context-aware recommender system exploits the knowledge extracted (profile in a particular situation ‘contextual profile’) automatically and the current user’s contextual profile to compute a list of contextual recommendations (analysis) adapted to the capability context.

Cependant ces systèmes OLAP sont élaborés pour un groupe de décideurs ou un sujet d’analyse «subject-oriented», pour lesquels sont présumés des besoins parfaitement identiques. Ce qui les rend mal adapté à un usage particulier. La personnalisation vise à mieux prendre en compte l’usager; ce papier présente une récapitulation sur tous les travaux entrepris dans ce sens avec une étude comparative.",

                "Description": "Management by project is actually a new theory of work organisation which provides, when properly organised, tremendous improvements in both productivity and innovation [Davenport, 93]. But project management techniques and implementation have to be oriented on business results and not only on control of projects.Project control variables are now clearly defined as in [Duncan, 96]: objectives, time, costs, quality, human resources, performance, processes and risk. Another point to be taken into account is the fact that risk is a distributed and unstructured knowledge, making difficult a systematic use. The objectives of PRIMA Project (Project RIsk MAnagement-IST-1999-10193) that we will present in this paper, follow all these points. Its main characteristics are:",

For this reason, predictive maintenance must be properly integrated in the production scheduling in order to take into account the wear and tear of the equipment to prevent it from the failure risk. In this context, we investigate the problem of a single multifunctional machine subjected to predictive maintenance based on Prognostic Health Management (PHM). We propose a new interpretation of PHM outputs to define the machine degradation corresponding to the processing of every task. We design a genetic algorithm that we called IPro-GA with the objective of minimizing the total interventions cost. Computational results show the efficiency of our scheme with an average deviation of about 0.1% over a lower bound.",

The proposed approaches aim to show that the efficiency of GAs in solving flowshop problems can be improved significantly by tailoring the various AIS operators to suit the problem structure. The proposed hybridization scheme is applied in two ways: (1) the first hybrid of GA and AIS introduces vaccination (Jiao and Wang, IEEE Trans Syst Man Sybernetics Part A Syst Hum 30(5):552–561, 2000) into the field of GAs based on the theory of immunity in biology, (2) the second takes its inspiration on the immune network theory (Perelson, Immunol Rev 110(1):5–36, 1989), and applied it to the field of GAs. The proposed hybrid metaheuristics produce high quality solutions as proved by the tests performed over Taillard’s (Eur J Oper Res 64(2):278 …",

Cependant l'ordonnancement de leurs activités respectives est indépendant, et ne tient pas compte de cette contrainte. Les ressources (machines) sont toujours considérées comme disponibles à tout moment ou éventuellement durant certaines fenêtres de temps. Dès lors la planification de la maintenance n'est jamais prioritaire sur la production, pour effectuer des interventions préventives. Les travaux de cette thèse proposent quelques éléments de réponse au problème de la planification commune et intégrée des tâches de maintenance et de production, avec comme objectif le respect des contraintes intrinsèques au problème. L'objectif de notre travail est double. D'une part démontrer la nécessité de développer des heuristiques d'ordonnancement conjoint production/maintenance pour atteindre l'objectif d'optimisation de la sûreté de fonctionnement du système de production. Dans ce contexte nous avons proposé l'adaptation d'un certains nombre d'heuristiques des approches constructive, itérative et évolutive pour le cas de l'ordonnancement conjoint production/maintenance dans un atelier de type flowshop de permutation. D'autre part, nous avons étudié la contribution de la maintenance à la robustesse de ces ordonnancements conjoints. Le modèle proposé a pour objectif d'inscrire la génération d'ordonnancements conjoints comme une démarche proactive, et de démontrer que l'intégration de la maintenance lors de la génération des ordonnancements de production est à mettre au profit de la robustesse de ces derniers.",

In this context, we investigate the permutation flowshop scheduling problem subjected to predictive maintenance based on prognostics and health management (PHM). To solve this problem, two integrated metaheuristics are proposed with the objective of minimising the makespan: a carefully tailored genetic algorithm (GA), and a variable neighbourhood search (VNS) incorporating well designed local search procedures. Moreover, we hybridise the two metaheuristics where the GA best solution is introduced as initial solution of VNS. The proposed metaheuristics use the fuzzy logic framework to deal with the uncertainties. To gain insight in the performance of the proposed methods, several computational experiments were conducted against Taillard's benchmarks endowed with the prognostics and …",

The proposed sequential algorithm, called SAS, consists of two steps: first the scheduling of the production jobs with Ant System algorithm (AS) by Dorigo and al. (1996) is considered. Then the insertion of the maintenance tasks is done according to several heuristics developed in previous works, taking the production scheduling as a strong constraint.

It consists of extracting and processing different failure types features to set up a knowledge base, which contains different failure types. The first phase consists in pre-processing the measured signals by aggregating them and preparing the data in exploitable formats for the clustering. The second phase ensures the induction machine operating mode diagnosis. A measured signals clustering is performed to build classes where each one represents a health state. A variable neighborhood search (VNS) metaheuristic is designed for data clustering. Moreover, VNS is hybridized with a classical mechanics-inspired optimization (CMO) metaheuristic to balance global exploration and local exploitation during the evolutionary process. The third phase consists of two-step failure detection, setting up a knowledge base containing different failure types, and defining a representative model for each failure type. In the learning step, different class features are extracted and inserted in the knowledge base to be used during the decision step. The proposed metaheuristic-based failure detection diagnosis approach is evaluated using PRONOSTIA and CWR bearing data experimental platforms vibration and temperature measurements. The achieved results clearly demonstrate the failure detection and diagnosis, efficiency, and effectiveness of the proposed metaheuristic approach.",

Furthermore, we will check if respecting the optimal intervals of maintenance activities guarantees a minimal robustness threshold. Then, we will try to identify from the used optimisation criteria those that allow making predictive schedules more robust. The computational experiments in a flowshop show that joint production and PM schedules are more robust than production schedules and maintenance provides an acceptable tradeoff between equipment reliability and performance loss under disruption.",

                "Description": "This research work addresses the integrated scheduling of jobs and flexible (non-systematic) maintenance interventions in permutation flowshop production systems. We propose a coordinated model in which the time intervals between successive maintenance tasks as well as their number are assumed to be non-fixed for each machine on the shopfloor. With such a flexible nature of maintenance activities, the resulting joint schedule is more practical and representative of real-world scenarios. Our goal is to determine the best job permutation in which flexible maintenance activities are properly incorporated. To tackle the NP-hard nature of this problem, an artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is developed to minimize the total production time (Makespan). Experiments are conducted utilizing well-known Taillard’s benchmarks, enriched with maintenance data, to compare the proposed algorithm performance against the variable neighbourhood search (VNS) method from the literature. Computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of both solution quality and computational times.",

It is applied for both production and joint production and maintenance scheduling as well. ETOMA architecture is composed of three modules: Develop, Test and Blackboard. The first one defines all agents that model the floor shop and their behavior. The second one takes care of testing the scheduling solution by using Taillard benchmarks depending on floor shop types. The considered types are Flow-shop, Job-shop and Open-shop. Finally, the Blackboard insures communication between the two predefined modules. ETOMA allows developing and testing any scheduling solution without imposing a specific architecture for agents. Moreover, ETOMA provides at the end of simulations a report composed of a recapitulative table or a curve according to user choice.",

This study tackles this crucial issue through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Representation Learning (RL). Several real-world, complex power system datasets characterized by their large size, dynamic nature, and high imbalance are examined. EDA serves as a fundamental step to provide insights into power system event scenarios, supported by a comprehensive preprocessing strategy that includes managing missing values, reducing dimensionality, denoising, removing outliers, and addressing class imbalance. Missing values are thoughtfully handled by evaluating mean values. Dimensionality reduction involves removing insignificant features that might provide misleading information, along with integrating Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Class-specific denoising …",

This problem can be modeled as an NP-hard optimization problem. Inspired from [25] [24] that combined Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Reinforcement Learning on large action-space environments, we adapt MCTS for the problem of Community Detection in Social Networks and propose MCTS-CD. MCTS-CD is an arm-bandit [2] anytime algorithm. We show that when compared to reference algorithms for CD such as Louvain [1], with allocating the same amount of resources, MCTS-CD acheives better results on many benchmark datasets such as Zachary Karate Club, Dolphin and the Pol Books datasets.",

As a consequence, it appeared natural to us to consider this inherent trait of social networks in order to better the hidden link prediction problem's resolution. In this paper, we propose a supervised learning algorithm that incorporates community information as a feature alongside other similarity metrics. The objective is to show that the information about the network's community structure will enhance the accuracy of the hidden link prediction in social networks. We tested the F1-score accuracy of the proposed model with four classifiers: SVM with an “rbf” kernel, Naive Bayes, random forest and K-NN. Experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of community information can only improve the quality of the hidden link prediction.",

In this paper, we analyze communities’ evolution prediction accuracy in dynamic social networks. The proposed approach combines two key concepts of the process, aiming to enrich the prediction model by additional information that could improve the results:(1) a tailored network splitting that results in snapshots of different periods rather than a static one, and (2) the change rates of communities’ features that characterize them over time instead of absolute values of features. Our experiments on four realworld social networks confirm that community evolution prediction can be achieved with a very high accuracy by using both tailored network splitting as a first step of prediction process and change rates of features.",

Cette hypothèse n’est pourtant pas fidèle à la réalité des ateliers de production. Cet article présente une nouvelle approche proactive-réactive pour la résolution du problème de l’ordonnancement conjoint de la production et la maintenance sur une machine. L’approche proposée prend en compte les incertitudes des données du problème. Ces incertitudes peuvent être des imprécisions relatives aux estimations des durées opératoires des tâches ou bien des incertitudes concernant l’apparition ou non d’événements pouvant affecter le déroulement du processus de production. Pour modéliser l’imprécision, nous utilisons la logique floue et pour traiter les différents événements nous utilisons l’approche par scénarios. La méthode proposée consiste en deux phases : (1) une phase proactive dans laquelle un ordonnancement sous incertitudes de base est généré   (2) une phase réactive pour la prise en compte des événements temps réels en vue d’adapter l’ordonnancement de base aux nouvelles données. Nous utilisons la technologie agent comme support de modélisation de l'atelier de production\"",

Graph burning offers a simplified deterministic model for addressing the NP-complete Graph Burning Problem. Acknowledging the unique characteristics of this problem, this paper introduces an efficient guided local search approach, leveraging betweenness centrality to initialize the solution process and integrating an augmented function with penalty terms to optimize the burning sequence. Using a binary search mechanism, candidate values are iteratively tested. Experimental results on 15 benchmark graphs demonstrate the algorithm’s superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

In this work, a hybridization of Q-Learning algorithm and Game theory is proposed to deal with the multi-objective Frequency Assignment Problem (FAP) in cellular networks considering two competing objectives namely interference and separation costs. The game embeds two learning players (agents), one for each objective. It occurs in a number of episodes in which a set of actions are considered to generate a frequency assignment plan providing a good trade-o between the two considered con icting objectives. The results of the experiments over two real-world cellular networks of two US cities, using Hypervolume and Nash metrics demonstrated the e ectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Optimizing compilers focus on modifying code so that it runs faster and uses the underlying hardware more efficiently.To do so, optimizing compilers often need to simplify or prove algebraic expressions, whether they were arithmetic or boolean. They generally use a term rewriting system that transforms syntactically the given expressions to either prove them or simplify them. A term rewriting system is essentially composed of a set of rewrite rules along with an algorithm that determines how these rules will be applied.",

However, its success relies greatly on a well-defined architecture that will provide scalable, dynamic, and secure basement to its deployment. In fact, several challenges stand between the conceptual idea of IoT, and the full deployment of its applications into our daily life. IoT deployment is closely related to the establishment of a standard architecture. This architecture should support future extensions, and covers IoT characteristics such as distributivity, interoperability, and scalability. A well defined, scalable, backward compatible, and secure architecture is required to bring the IoT concept closer to reality. In the literature, several architectures have been proposed.

The secure channel allows the constrained node to transmit captured data while ensuring confidentiality and authentication. To achieve this goal, we propose offloading highly consuming cryptographic primitives to third parties. As a result, the constrained node obtains assistance from powerful entities.

For sensitive and mission-critical sensing tasks, securing multicast applications is therefore highly desirable.

However, the majority of the proposed solutions are not adapted to the IoT and its strong processing, storage, and energy constraints. In this context, we introduce a novel decentralized and batch-based group key management protocol to secure multicast communications. Our protocol is simple and it reduces the rekeying overhead triggered by membership changes in dynamic and mobile groups and guarantees both backward and forward secrecy.

Nevertheless, IoT will likely present dynamic and mobile applications. In this paper, we introduce potential security threats on RPL, in particular Sybil attack when the Sybil nodes are mobile. In addition, we present an analytical analysis and a discussion on how network performances can be affected.

Designing these protocols is challenging, especially in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT). Indeed, the presence of heterogeneous and dynamic members within the collaborative groups usually involves resource constrained entities, which require energy-aware protocols to manage frequent arrivals and departures of members. Moreover, both fault tolerance and scalability are sought for sensitive and large collaborative groups. To address these challenges, we propose to enhance our previously proposed protocol (i.e. DBGK) with polynomial computations. In fact, our contribution in this paper, allows additional controllers to be included with no impact on storage cost regarding constrained members.

This interconnection generates a huge amount of private data, which needs to be processed, transferred, and stored. Using classical security solutions to ensure data confidentiality in this context is challenging. In fact, these solutions have to deal with high scalability requirements, heterogeneity of the involved building blocks, in addition to resources scarcity of the embedded devices such as energy and computational limitations. In this thesis, we investigate the issue of designing safe security protocols while taking into consideration IoT specificities. We proceed by studying the IoT concept, its applications, along with the different architectures and communication protocols. These latter are at the basis of any security protocol deployment. Then, we focus on the efforts of the research community by analyzing the existing state of the art approaches. Relying on the detected shortcomings, we propose four secure and energy-aware key management protocols to address the issue of establishing secure communication channels between IoT entities. To assess our protocols, we conduct an analysis using a formal validation tool to validate their security properties. Furthermore, we estimate both their computational and communication overhead to highlight energy savings. The obtained results prove the viability of our proposed solutions in the sensitive and constrained environment of IoT applications.",

Indeed, resources scarcity in such environment hinders the implementation of existing standard based protocols. Among these protocols, MIKEY (Multimedia Internet KEYing) aims at establishing security credentials between two com- municating entities. However, the existing MIKEY modes fail to meet IoT specificities. In particular, the pre-shared key mode is energy efficient, but suffers from severe scalability issues. On the other hand, asymmetric modes such as the public key mode are scalable, but are highly resource consuming. To address this issue, we combine two previously proposed approaches to introduce a new distributed MIKEY mode. Indeed, relying on a cooperative approach, a set of third parties is used to discharge the constrained nodes from heavy computational operations. Doing so, the pre-shared mode is used in the constrained part of the network, while the public key mode is used in the unconstrained part of the network. Preliminary results show that our proposed mode is energy preserving whereas its security properties are kept safe.",

The Internet of Things (IoT) dimension includes additional challenges. In fact, resource constrained members within dynamic and heterogeneous groups are unable to run existing group key protocols. Furthermore, these protocols need to be scalable and fault tolerant to suit growing and sensitive groups. To face these issues, we enhance our previously proposed protocol called Decentralized Batch-based Group Key protocol (DBGK). Using polynomial computation to secure data exchanges, we considerably improve its scalability, fault tolerance and collusion freeness properties. This gain is achieved thanks to the ability to include additional unconstrained members (controllers) while inducing a very limited cost on the constrained members. Furthermore, we include an energy preserving blockchain-based mechanism to authenticate group members credentials in a distributed manner. To assess our new protocol called DiStributed Batch-based Group Key protocol (DsBGK), we performed a detailed theoretical security analysis to evaluate its behaviour against well studied attacks in the literature. Furthermore, we validated this analysis using a formal validation tool. To evaluate DsBGK performances , we performed extensive simulations. We proceeded by comparing DsBGK in term of energy cost, first, with DBGK, then with other analogous protocols from the literature. The results confirmed the security soundness of DsBGK, in addition to an improved energy efficiency compared to its peers.",

However, due to the limited resource available in such systems and privacy concerns that might rise from the capture of personal data, security issues constitute a major obstacle to their deployment. Authentication of the different entities involved and data confidentiality constitute the main concerns for users that need to be addressed. In this paper, we propose a new key management scheme for an ehealth application to allow sensors and the Base Station (BS) to negotiate certain security credentials that will be used to protect the information flow. Our prtocol provides a strong level of security guaranteeing authentication and data confidentiality while the scarcity of resources is taken into consideration. The scheme is based on a lightweight Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) where the sensors have to perform only one Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) decryption in the key establishment process. Data exchanges are then secured by the use of symmetric encryption. In addition, Time Stamps are used to prevent replay attacks along with Message Code Authentication (MAC) to ensure integrity.",

                "Description": "Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful tool for leveraging the vast quantities of data generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Its advantage lies in its ability to preserve participants’ data privacy through keeping it local. In addition, FL alleviates the communication overhead in cloud-centric ML for IoT approaches, through sharing model updates instead of large raw data, which optimizes bandwidth use. Furthermore, decentralized FL has been useful in addressing security concerns typical in conventional settings. Nevertheless, in such zero-trust scenarios where there is no central coordinator, nodes exhibit reluctance to participate due to the lack of clear rewards and trust issues. Additionally, constrained FL clients may abandon their tasks, which negatively impacts learning performance. In this paper, we propose a double-incentive FL approach to address the dual challenge of node reluctance and …",

                "Description": "Cloud computing has raised concerns about security, causing many companies to hesitate in adopting it. Despite these concerns, there are methods available to address the risks associated with implementing a business process (BP) in the cloud. One common approach involves breaking down the BP model into smaller fragments, allowing each cloud provider access to a specific part of the overall model. However, this method fails to protect against collaboration between malicious cloud providers, which, by pooling their knowledge, can exploit the logic of the process. To tackle this issue, our paper proposes an approach that effectively manages coalitions when they arise. To do this, we introduce observer and deceiver fragments, which play a crucial role in redirecting the process execution toward a fake task. This strategic redirection prevents access to important information. The obtained results demonstrate …",

To mitigate risks, they fragment processes across multiple cloud platforms, interconnected through synchronization messages and reinforced by separation constraints. Exploring machine learning techniques, particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), becomes essential for addressing optimization challenges in dynamic cloud environments, handling data flow, scalability, and security. This paper proposes leveraging Q-learning, a form of RL, for efficient task allocation in cloud computing. Unlike traditional methods, this approach ensures effective task assignment management in complex and evolving environments, reducing information overload per cloud.

However, as such processes express their know-how and because of the nature of the cloud, they are still reluctant to do so. Although some solutions already exist and consist in splitting the model into a collaboration of BP fragments for a deployment in a multi-cloud context, none of them takes into account the possibility of collusion between the clouds executing the different fragments. To address this issue, we propose in this paper an approach that introduces decoy processes, having the same structure of the real one with decision and synthesis strategy making that are completely different of those of the real process.

However, existing MIKEY modes fail to meet the requirements of low-power and low-processing devices. To address this issue, we combine two previously proposed approaches to introduce a new compressed and distributed MIKEY mode applied to a collaborative internet of things context. A set of third parties is used to discharge the constrained nodes from heavy computational operations. Doing so, the MIKEY pre-shared mode is used in the constrained part of network, while the public key mode is used in the unconstrained part of the network. Furthermore, to mitigate the communication cost we introduce a new header compression scheme that reduces the size of MIKEY's header from 12 bytes to 3 bytes in the best compression case.

One of the earliest approaches toward ontology evaluation was the introduction of competency questions, ie, natural language questions that the ontology should be able to answer. Since the ontology is a machine readable representation of knowledge, end-users should be able to query it using a formal language, such as SPARQL; however, translating natural language competency questions into SPARQL queries is not a trivial task. In the scope of this paper, we consider competency questions of HERO (Higher Education Reference Ontology) ontology we have developed.

                "Description": "Most ontologies are application ontologies designed for specific applications. Reference ontology is able to contribute significantly in resolving or at least reducing the issue of ontology applications specificity and hence increasing ontology reusability. Particularly considering higher education domain, we think that a reference ontology dedicated to this knowledge area, can be regarded as a valuable tool for researchers and institutional employees interested in analyzing the system of higher education as a whole. This paper describes, a reference ontology called HERO ontology, which stands for “Higher Education Reference Ontology”. We explain HERO ontology building process from requirements specification until ontology evaluation using NeOn methodology. HERO ontology is projected to be a reusable and generalisable resource of academic knowledge which can be filtered to meet the needs of any knowledge-based application that requires structural information. It is distinct from application ontologies in that it is not intended as an end-user application and does not target the needs of any particular user group.

This article focuses on the little-used technology of ontologies, particularly Business Model Ontologies. Ontologies allow the representation of very abstract concepts, such as Business Models. The concept consists of four pillars, one of which, the “customer interface” is related to Customer Relationship Management (CRM). This paper proposes a modeling approach and a generic CRM model for the simulation of the value generated by information and communication technologies. The model must have a sufficient level of accuracy to achieve meaningful and helpful results, while maintaining a sufficiently generic level of abstraction to allow rapid implementation.",

In order to reach timely and appropriate decisions, crisis response organizations need to rapidly obtain an accurate situation awareness of the crisis context. A process by which they need to gather, access, and exchange near real-time information about the events circumstances throughout the entire crisis life cycle. Such activities imply a huge participation of collaborating organizations and goes even beyond their internal borders to reach the entire crisis-stricken community. Recent crisis and disaster situations have demonstrated the crucial role citizens can and must play in responding to such events. The growing development of advanced technologies has open the door for large public to be a key factor in making decisions and conducting guided response actions. We propose in this …",

One of the well-known domain ontologies validation approaches proposes a set of competency questions, covering the domain represented by the ontology, translating these questions into SPARQL queries, running them on the ontology, and comparing the obtained results with the expected ones. This paper presents an approach to translate natural language competency questions into SPARQL queries to assist domain experts in testing ontologies and users considering exploring ontologies for further exploitation. The implementation and experimentation of the proposed approach are described. The resulting tool proposes a fully automatic and semi-automatic execution, enabling end-users to parameter the approach phases.",

This paper examines the opportunity of using spatial data warehousing technique in the OH management framework to integrate various data formats such as geographic (workplace data) and thematic data which are usually scattered across multiple, dispersed and fragmented systems. We propose a SOLAP architecture that supports the whole process of risk management for prevention purposes.

BPI requires the integration of business processes and their supporting systems across multiple autonomous organizations. However, such integration is complex and can face coordination complexities that occur during the resource exchanges between the partners’ processes. This article proposes a new method called Process Mining for Business Process Integration (PM4BPI) that helps process designers to perform BPI by creating new process models that cross the boundaries of multiple organizations from a collection of process event logs. PM4BPI uses federated process mining techniques to detect incompatibilities before the integration of the partners’ processes. Then, it applies process adaptation patterns to solve …",

However, case studies of ontologies describing enterprise business models have rarely been reported in the literature, although there are a few indications of the impact of these ontologies on business models; however, these indications do not ease the assessment of the added value of this type of ontology. The aim of this paper is two-fold; on one hand, we highlight the lack of task-based assessment of enterprise business model ontologies via some concrete case studies, and on the other hand, we aim to tackle this issue by proposing indicators intended for measuring the impact of business model ontologies in the framework of enterprise business models.",

This article presents a comprehensive approach for integrating the crowdsourcing process to the collaborative decisional process in crisis situations. Within the approach three aspects are highlighted: the coordination work that exists between the relevant stakeholders in making collective decisions, the modeling of case dependent activities within the decisional process, and the detailed modeling of decision-related tasks.

Indeed, dealing with such situations calls for many groups from different institutions and organizations to interact and collaborate their efforts in a timely manner to reduce their effects. However, response organizations are challenged by several problems. The urgent need of a shared and mutual situational awareness, information and knowledge about the situation are distributed across time and space and owned by both organizations and people. Additionally, decisions and actions have to be achieved promptly, under stress and time pressure. The contribution outlined in this paper is suggesting a crowdsourcing-based approach for decision making in collaborative crisis management based on the literature requirements. The objective of the approach is to support situational awareness and enhance the decision making process by involving citizens in providing opinions and evaluations of potential response actions.",

We use then this generated knowledge to create knowledge-driven cartographies. School websites are essential to share information and data between users, but the knowledge contained in these websites are often informal and difficult to locate. This is due to the large amount of existing pages which make navigation more complex. Then, to simplify knowledge localization, we map the school website content and generate ontology-driven visual cartographies where users can find the school teachers' skills and knowledge. Our automatic method and tool enables us to process a large collection of web pages in a short time. Our method comprises four steps: data preparation, ontology domain construction, mapping and visualization.",

Our research was conducted using a design science research methodology. It is a methodology for creating and evaluating IT artifacts to solve identified organizational problems. We used Wang's safety intelligence framework and the recommendations of the ISO 45001 model from extant literature to inform the Design. While creating our artifact, we chose to make an inventory of occupational risk prevention practices in Algeria.

                "Description": " With the advent of Linked Open Data (LOD) initiatives, organizations have seen the opportunity of augmenting their internal data cube systems with these external data. While IT actors manage technical issues of internal and external sources, a new actor has emerged “the Chief Data Officer” (CDO), the role of which is to align and prioritize data activities with key organizational priorities and goals. Existing literature managing the incorporation of LOD in internal Data cubes mainly focus on technical aspects of the LOD source and ignores the CDO role in this strategy. In this paper, we claim that technical actions should be conducted by the managerial level, which is reflected through the goals of the organization data cube and their related Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). For doing this, we first propose a metamodel aligning the three models: the data-flow model, the goal model and the KPI model. Then …",

In this work, we propose to include the semantic perspective to our current competence location system by building an application ontology which will control specifically the used vocabulary and hopefully increase the whole system effectiveness. In order to achieve these goals, we propose a new system architecture of which the most crucial element is an application ontology dedicated to the localization of intra-school skills.",

First, it transforms OGD into LOD, adhering to the four LD principles. Second, it publishes the generated LOD in the OGD portal, following accessibility best practices. Third, it exploits the published LOD through an interface that offers multiple services. In addition, this paper carried out functional and performance tests to prove the proposed approach’s effectiveness and performance.The evaluation phase demonstrated that the LOD-GePEx approach is effective and efficient.

As governments, being among the largest producers and collectors of data, are making OGD available online in diverse formats, primarily Word, PDF, or Excel, they are contributing significantly to this global initiative. The OGD initiative holds immense potential to revolutionize the way we access and use government data. Its primary objective is to enhance the discoverability, accessibility, and availability of data in alternative and preferably machine-readable formats. This, in turn, empowers a diverse set of stakeholders to develop innovative data applications under licensing schemes that permit unrestricted reuse. Despite these promising aspects, challenges such as data heterogeneity, data protection, data quality, and data provenance issues persist. This study aims to analyze and categorize these challenges and obstacles that hinder the OGD initiative from realizing its full potential, with a particular emphasis on data protection and security concerns for data providers.",

                "Description": "AI, cybersecurity, cloud computing, and robotics are becoming ubiquitous technologies in the industry sector, which has witnessed several successive industrial revolutions: mechanization, electrification, digitalization, and now Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 refers to the technologies reinventing manufacturing practices, leading to smart factories where systems, machines, and products communicate constantly. To implement I4.0 successfully, companies must manage, control, and contain many changes and risks. As a result, organizations must ensure that introducing these new technologies is valuable, determine what challenges they face and what opportunities they can take advantage of, and anticipate their future needs and the conditions to implement to optimize their resources. In addition, the enterprise architecture can contribute to the good governance of I4.0 technologies within an enterprise. Using an enterprise architecture, a company can better understand its current situation, capabilities, and how it interacts with its environment. This enables it to align IT with business needs and assess the need to adopt new technologies for any organization with strategic goals. Specifically, this study aims to determine how TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework) could assist companies in assessing the necessity of implementing Industry 4.0 technologies. Specifically, the study explores the factors influencing the company's transformation, the potential benefits of I4.0 technologies, and the phases and artifacts stakeholders should consider when adopting I4.0.",

                "Description": "Avec la multiplication des sources LOD (Linked Open Data ou don-nées ouvertes et liées), les organisations ont vu l'opportunité d'étendre leurs cubes de données internes avec ce type de données externes. Les sources LOD sont certes porteuses d'une réelle valeur ajoutée, mais elles ont apporté leur lot de difficultés techniques liées à la gestion de ces données (flux ETL, volume des données, qualité de la source, etc.). Nous constatons dans la littérature existante, que la décision d'incorporer les LOD dans un cube se concentre sur la gestion de ces difficultés techniques, alors que cette décision est avant tout'organisa-tionnelle'. Cette omission s' explique par le fait que l'intégration des LOD est étudiée selon une vision orientée sources, alors qu'une vision orientée besoins serait plus adéquate pour étudier efficacement la pertinence de l'intégration de cette nouvelle source. Dans cet article, nous apportons une vision organisationnelle orientée buts dans laquelle les indicateurs de performance clés (key Performance Indicators-KPI-) sont l'élément central liant les sources de données aux objectifs organisationnels. Nous proposons une approche orientée buts permettant d'estimer la valeur organisationnelle (via les valeurs des KPI) des ressources LOD dans le cube. L'approche est basée sur un méta-modèle alignant les trois modèles: le modèle de données, le modèle de buts et le modèle KPI. Des expérimentations sont menées pour valider notre approche.",

                "Description": "A business model is an attractive concept for business management. It can benefit from ontology paradigms that are described more formally and more precisely. However, case studies of ontologies describing enterprise business models have rarely been reported in the literature, although there are a few indications of the impact of these ontologies on business models; however, these indications do not ease the assessment of the added value of this type of ontology. The aim of this paper is two-fold; on one hand, we highlight the lack of task-based assessment of enterprise business model ontologies via some concrete case studies, and on the other hand, we aim to tackle this issue by proposing indicators intended for measuring the impact of business model ontologies in the framework of enterprise business models.",

Et puis, les interactions à tous les niveaux apparaissent comme une réelle force pour les entreprises agiles, car des idées nouvelles, produits, services voire solutions émergent des multiples échanges qui se passent au sein des organisations et plus particulièrement les processus business. Les interactions au même titre que l’environnement externe, sont les moteurs de l’innovation et du changement dans les organisations agiles.Nous nous sommes intéressés aux réseaux sociaux d’entreprise qui sont centrés davantage sur les personnes et les relations qu'elles peuvent entretenir que sur des processus de travail. L’objet de ce travail est de répondre à la question suivante:\" en quoi ces réseaux sociaux d’entreprise sont susceptibles d'influencer l’agilité d’une organisation?\".",

Nous nous intéressons particulièrement à l’activité «encadrement & suivi de stagiaires» complexe, exigeante, où le tacite prend souvent le dessus sur l’explicite. Les interactions multiples entre enseignants, enseignants et professionnels durant le suivi des stages constituent souvent la clé de la réussite du projet tant sur le plan académique que sur le plan professionnel.Toutefois, la réalité dévoile souvent un cloisonnement voire un isolement de l’encadreur face à ses stagiaires alors que le besoin d’impliquer d’autre personnes dans ce travail d’encadrement se fait souvent par à coups, selon des affinités, sans toutefois tirer profit des expériences parallèles qui représenteraient un capital de savoir et savoir-faire d’une utilité indéniable.",

The proposed system introduces a dialogue between two communities of agents (production and maintenance) leading to a high level of cooperation. It also provides a framework in order to react to the disturbances occurring in the workshop. This aspect is mainly concerned by corrective maintenance activities (machine breakdowns). The proposed multi-agent system is based on the integrated strategy which consists of a simultaneous scheduling of both production and preventive maintenance activities. The objective is then to optimize an objective function which takes into account both maintenance and production criterion. The main point is to show how the proposed multi-agent system is used to generate a joint production and …",
